**Definition**
Mobile-first is a design approach where the layout and functionality of a website or application are created starting from the smallest screen (mobile devices) and then scaled up for tablets and desktops.

**Types**

* Responsive mobile-first design
* Adaptive mobile-first design

**Working**
Designers first create the mobile version with essential features, minimal layout, and optimized performance. CSS media queries are then used to progressively enhance the design for larger screens.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Mobile → Tablet → Desktop
(Simple) → (Enhanced) → (Full Layout)
```

**Advantages**

* Better performance on mobile devices
* Prioritizes essential content
* Improves user experience
* Easier to scale layouts up than down

**Disadvantages**

* Desktop designs may feel constrained
* Requires careful planning
* Can be time-consuming initially

**Examples**

* A website built with the smallest layout first, adding grid systems and navigation for larger screens later.

**Short code snippets**

```css
/* Mobile-first default */
body { font-size: 16px; }

/* Larger screens */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  body { font-size: 18px; }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  body { font-size: 20px; }
}
```

**Applications**

* Modern web design frameworks
* Responsive websites
* Progressive web apps (PWAs)

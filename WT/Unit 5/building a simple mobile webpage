Building a simple mobile webpage involves creating a basic HTML structure, applying mobile-optimized design techniques, and ensuring the page adapts well to small screens. The key goal is to deliver fast loading, touch-friendly UI with minimal layout complexity.

A mobile webpage begins with a responsive viewport meta tag, which tells the browser to scale the page correctly on mobile devices. Next, a simple and clean layout is created using semantic HTML elements. CSS media queries are then added to adjust styles for different screen sizes. Touch-friendly elements like larger buttons, readable text, and sufficient spacing are incorporated to enhance usability. Finally, the page is tested on different screen sizes to ensure proper responsiveness and performance.

**Steps**

1. **Create the basic HTML structure**
   Begin with a standard HTML5 document including `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.

2. **Add the mobile viewport meta tag**
   This ensures proper scaling on mobile devices:

   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   ```

3. **Write minimal, mobile-friendly HTML content**
   Use clear headings, paragraphs, and sections. Avoid heavy layouts.

4. **Apply CSS for responsive design**
   Use flexible units (`%, rem`) and apply media queries for larger screens:

   ```css
   @media (min-width: 768px) {
     .container { width: 80%; margin: auto; }
   }
   ```

5. **Add touch-friendly UI elements**
   Ensure buttons are large enough and text is easily readable on small screens.

6. **Test on multiple devices or using browser developer tools**
   Check appearance, layout behavior, and readability across various screen sizes.

7. **Optimize the page**
   Minimize images, remove unused CSS/JS, and ensure fast load times since mobile networks may be slow.

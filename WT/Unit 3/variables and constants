**Definition**
Variables and constants in TypeScript are used to store data values. Variables can change during execution, while constants cannot be reassigned once defined.

**Types**

* `let` → block-scoped variable
* `var` → function-scoped variable (not recommended)
* `const` → block-scoped constant

**Working**
TypeScript enforces type checking on variables and constants. You can specify a type explicitly or allow TypeScript to infer it. Constants must be initialized at declaration and cannot be reassigned.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Memory
 ├── let → value can change
 ├── var → function-scoped
 └── const → fixed value
```

**Advantages**

* Type safety prevents invalid assignments
* Clear distinction between mutable and immutable data
* Reduces runtime errors
* Better code readability

**Disadvantages**

* Extra type definitions may feel verbose
* Must follow strict typing rules

**Examples**
Variables:

```ts
let age: number = 20;
age = 21;
```

Constant:

```ts
const pi: number = 3.14;
// pi = 3.15;  // Error
```

Type inference:

```ts
let city = "Mumbai";  // inferred as string
```

**Short code snippets**

```ts
const isLoggedIn: boolean = true;
let score: number;
score = 95;
```

**Applications**

* Storing configuration values
* Defining state in applications
* Managing immutable values (API keys, settings)
* General-purpose variable handling in TS programs

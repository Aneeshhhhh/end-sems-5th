**Definition**
Angular components are the basic building blocks of an Angular application. Each component controls a part of the UI and contains its own logic, template, and styles.

**Types**

* Root component (`AppComponent`)
* Feature components
* Shared/reusable components
* Presentational vs container components

**Working**
A component is defined using the `@Component` decorator. It includes:

* **Template (HTML)** → what the user sees
* **Class (TS)** → logic and data
* **Styles (CSS)** → appearance
  Angular renders components in a tree structure and updates them through change detection.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Component
 ├── HTML (View)
 ├── TS (Logic)
 └── CSS (Styles)
```

**Advantages**

* Reusable UI blocks
* Easy to test and maintain
* Clear separation of logic and view
* Supports modular application design

**Disadvantages**

* Too many small components can complicate structure
* Requires learning Angular decorators and bindings

**Examples**

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello',
  template: '<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>'
})
export class HelloComponent {
  name = 'Aneesh';
}
```

**Short code snippets**

```ts
ng generate component home
```

**Applications**

* Building UI layouts
* Creating reusable widgets
* Structuring large Angular applications

**Definition**
Angular data binding is the mechanism that synchronizes data between the component (TypeScript class) and the view (HTML template), ensuring UI and logic stay in sync.

**Types**

* **Interpolation** (`{{ }}`) → Displaying component data in HTML
* **Property Binding** (`[property]`) → Setting HTML element properties
* **Event Binding** (`(event)`) → Handling user actions
* **Two-way Binding** (`[(ngModel)]`) → Syncing both ways between UI and component

**Working**
Angular automatically updates the DOM when component data changes and updates the component when the user interacts with the UI. The Angular change detection system ensures smooth synchronization.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Component ↔ View

Property   Event

```

**Advantages**

* Reduces manual DOM manipulation
* Keeps UI and logic consistent
* Simplifies handling of user input
* Cleaner and more readable templates

**Disadvantages**

* Two-way binding may cause complexity in large apps
* Overuse can reduce performance

**Examples**
Interpolation:

```html
<p>{{ title }}</p>
```

Property binding:

```html
<img [src]="imageUrl">
```

Event binding:

```html
<button (click)="sayHello()">Click</button>
```

Two-way binding:

```html
<input [(ngModel)]="username">
```

**Applications**

* Forms
* Dynamic UI updates
* Interactive components
* Real-time dashboards

**Definition**
Angular forms are used to handle user input, validation, and data collection. Angular provides two approaches: **Template-driven forms** and **Reactive forms**.

**Types**

* **Template-driven forms** – Simple, uses HTML + directives (`ngModel`).
* **Reactive forms** – More powerful, uses TypeScript classes (`FormGroup`, `FormControl`).

**Working**
Template-driven forms rely on Angular’s directives in the template and Angular automatically tracks form state.
Reactive forms are created in the component class and give full control over validation, form structure, and data flow.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
User Input → FormControl/FormGroup → Validation → Component → Submit
```

**Advantages**

* Built-in validation support
* Two-way data binding in template-driven forms
* Reactive forms offer stronger control and testability
* Real-time form state tracking (valid, dirty, touched)

**Disadvantages**

* Template-driven forms become complex for large apps
* Reactive forms require more setup and boilerplate

**Examples**

**Template-Driven Form:**

```html
<form #f="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="submit(f.value)">
  <input name="username" ngModel required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

**Component:**

```ts
submit(data: any) {
  console.log(data);
}
```

**Reactive Form:**

```ts
form = new FormGroup({
  username: new FormControl('', Validators.required)
});
```

**HTML:**

```html
<form [formGroup]="form" (ngSubmit)="submit()">
  <input formControlName="username">
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>
```

**Short code snippets**

```ts
import { FormGroup, FormControl, Validators } from '@angular/forms';
```

**Applications**

* Login and registration forms
* Dashboards and data-entry modules
* Validating user inputs
* Dynamic and complex form structures

**Definition**
MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture is a design pattern that separates an application into three connected components—Model, View, and Controller—to organize code, improve maintainability, and support scalable development.

**Types**

* **Model** – Manages data, business logic, and database operations.
* **View** – User interface that displays data from the Model.
* **Controller** – Handles user requests, updates the Model, and selects the appropriate View.

**Working**

1. The **user interacts** with the View.
2. The **Controller processes** the request and updates the Model.
3. The **Model updates** its data.
4. The **View renders** the updated data to the user.

This creates a clean separation of concerns, allowing UI, logic, and data layers to evolve independently.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
User
 ↓
Controller → Updates → Model → Sends Data → View → Displays to User
```

**Advantages**

* Better organization and modularity
* Easy maintenance and testing
* Reusable components
* Clear separation of concerns

**Disadvantages**

* More files/structure required
* Can be complex for small projects

**Examples**
A login request:

* Controller receives username/password
* Controller asks Model to validate
* Model responds with validation result
* Controller returns appropriate View

**Short code snippets**

```js
// Example Controller
exports.showHome = (req, res) => {
  res.render("home");
};
```

**Applications**

* Web frameworks (Express MVC, Django, Ruby on Rails)
* Enterprise applications
* Scalable front-end architectures (Angular-inspired MVC)

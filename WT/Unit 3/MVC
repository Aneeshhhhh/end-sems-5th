**Definition**
MVC (Model–View–Controller) is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic). It promotes cleaner code, modularity, and easier maintenance.

**Types**

* Traditional MVC
* MVVM (variation)
* MVP (variation)

**Working**
The **Model** manages data and business logic.
The **View** displays data to the user.
The **Controller** handles input, updates the Model, and selects the View.
This separation ensures changes in one part don’t break the others.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
User → Controller → Model → View → User
```

**Advantages**

* Clear separation of concerns
* Easier testing and maintenance
* Reusable components
* Better organization for large apps

**Disadvantages**

* More files and structure required
* Overkill for small applications

**Examples**
Folder structure:

```
models/
views/
controllers/
```

**Short code snippets**

```js
// controller example
exports.getHome = (req, res) => {
  res.render("home", { title: "Home" });
};
```

**Applications**

* Web apps (Express, Django, Rails)
* UI-heavy applications
* Large-scale maintainable systems

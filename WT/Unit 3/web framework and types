**Definition**
A web framework is a software framework that provides tools, libraries, and structure for building web applications, handling tasks like routing, templates, request processing, and backend logic.

**Types**

* **Front-end Web Frameworks** – Used for building user interfaces (e.g., Angular, React, Vue).
* **Back-end Web Frameworks** – Used for server-side logic, routing, databases (e.g., Express.js, Django, Spring).
* **Full-stack Frameworks** – Provide both front-end and back-end features (e.g., Meteor, Next.js).

**Working**
A web framework receives HTTP requests, routes them to handlers, processes data, renders pages or JSON responses, and returns them to the client. It abstracts low-level operations to simplify development.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Client → Request → Framework (Routing + Logic + Rendering) → Response → Client
```

**Advantages**

* Faster development
* Built-in security features
* Reusable components
* Organized code structure

**Disadvantages**

* Learning curve
* Framework limitations
* Upgrades may break compatibility

**Examples**

* Express.js server
* Angular SPA
* Django backend

**Short code snippets**

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Hello"));
```

**Applications**

* Web apps
* REST APIs
* Dashboards
* E-commerce sites

**Definition**
Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular is a design pattern where objects (services) are created and supplied to components automatically instead of components creating them manually.

**Types**

* **Constructor injection** (most common)
* **Module-level providers**
* **Component-level providers**
* **Root-level providers (`providedIn: 'root'`)**

**Working**
Components request a dependency (service) through their constructor. Angular’s DI container looks for the provider and injects a single shared instance automatically.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Component → asks for Service
DI Container → provides Service instance
```

**Advantages**

* Reduces code duplication
* Promotes modular, testable design
* Decouples components from service creation
* Automatic instance management

**Disadvantages**

* Requires understanding providers hierarchy
* Misplaced providers may create multiple instances

**Examples**
Service:

```ts
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class AuthService {
  login() { return true; }
}
```

Injection into component:

```ts
constructor(private auth: AuthService) {}

ngOnInit() {
  this.auth.login();
}
```

**Short code snippets**

```ts
ng g service auth
```

**Applications**

* Injecting services like HttpClient
* Sharing data across components
* Authentication and API handling
* Any logic not belonging in components

**Definition**
ReactJS is a JavaScript library used for building fast, component-based user interfaces. It focuses on the View layer and uses a virtual DOM for efficient rendering.

**Types**

* **Functional Components**
* **Class Components**
* **Controlled & Uncontrolled Components**
* **Pure Components**

**Working**
React breaks the UI into reusable components. Each component manages its own state. When state changes, React updates a **virtual DOM**, compares it with the real DOM (diffing), and updates only the changed parts (reconciliation), improving performance.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
State/Props → Component → Virtual DOM → Diff → Real DOM Update
```

**Advantages**

* Fast rendering using Virtual DOM
* Component-based architecture
* Reusable UI components
* Strong ecosystem (hooks, router, redux)
* Easy integration with other libraries

**Disadvantages**

* Learning curve (JSX, hooks)
* Requires tooling (webpack, babel)
* Fast updates may cause breaking changes

**Examples**
Functional component:

```jsx
function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello React</h1>;
}
```

Component with state:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

**Short code snippets**
Create app:

```bash
npx create-react-app myapp
```

**Applications**

* SPA (Single Page Applications)
* Dashboards & admin panels
* Social media apps
* Real-time UI updates
* E-commerce frontends

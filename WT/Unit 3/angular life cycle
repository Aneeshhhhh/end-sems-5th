Angular lifecycle refers to the sequence of events that occur from the creation of a component to its destruction. Angular provides lifecycle hooks—special methods you can implement to run code at specific stages.

**Main Lifecycle Hooks (in order):**

1. **ngOnChanges()** – Runs when input properties change.
2. **ngOnInit()** – Runs once after the first ngOnChanges; good for initialization.
3. **ngDoCheck()** – Custom change detection logic.
4. **ngAfterContentInit()** – After content projection.
5. **ngAfterContentChecked()** – After every content check.
6. **ngAfterViewInit()** – After component view loads.
7. **ngAfterViewChecked()** – After every view check.
8. **ngOnDestroy()** – Cleanup before component removal.

If you want, I can give a diagram or 6-mark expanded version.

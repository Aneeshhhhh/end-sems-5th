**Definition**
TypeScript (TS) is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, interfaces, and modern language features, which are compiled into standard JavaScript for execution.

**Types**

* Primitive types (string, number, boolean)
* Custom types (interfaces, type aliases)
* Classes and generics
* Enums

**Working**
TypeScript code (`.ts`) is checked by the compiler for type errors and then transpiled into JavaScript (`.js`). This ensures fewer runtime bugs, better tooling, and clearer code structure while still running anywhere JavaScript runs.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
TypeScript (.ts) → Compiler → JavaScript (.js) → Browser/Node.js
```

**Advantages**

* Early error detection through static typing
* Better IntelliSense and IDE support
* Scalable for large projects
* Supports modern JS features

**Disadvantages**

* Requires compilation step
* Learning curve for beginners
* Stricter syntax may slow initial development

**Examples**

```ts
let name: string = "Aneesh";
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Short code snippets**
Compile TS to JS:

```bash
tsc file.ts
```

**Applications**

* Large-scale web apps
* Angular projects
* Node.js backends
* Enterprise applications

Here are **6 Angular CLI commands** with short explanations:

**1. `ng new <app-name>`**
Creates a new Angular project with all required files, folders, and configuration.

**2. `ng serve`**
Starts the development server and runs the app locally at `http://localhost:4200/`. Automatically reloads on changes.

**3. `ng generate component <name>` or `ng g c <name>`**
Creates a new component with `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, and test files. Updates module declarations automatically.

**4. `ng generate service <name>` or `ng g s <name>`**
Creates a new service file and prepares it for dependency injection.

**5. `ng build`**
Compiles the Angular project into static files inside the `dist/` folder for production or deployment.

**6. `ng test`**
Runs unit tests for the project using Karma and Jasmine.

If you want, I can also add routing-related or module-generation commands.

Inter-component communication in React refers to how components **send data to each other**. React has a **unidirectional data flow**, so data always moves **top → down** unless special mechanisms are used.

**Ways components communicate:**

1. **Parent → Child (Props)**
   The parent passes data to a child using props.

   ```jsx
   <Child message="Hello" />
   ```

2. **Child → Parent (Callback Functions)**
   Parent sends a function to the child; child calls it to send data back.

   ```jsx
   props.onSelect(value);
   ```

3. **Sibling → Sibling (Via Parent State)**
   Both siblings talk through the parent component’s state.

4. **Global Communication (Context API)**
   When many components need the same data (theme, user info).
   Avoids "prop drilling".

5. **State Management Libraries (Redux / Zustand / MobX)**
   Used for large apps where many components need shared state.

6. **Refs (rare cases)**
   Used to directly access a child component's DOM or methods.

If you want, I can expand each with examples.

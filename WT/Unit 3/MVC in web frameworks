MVC in web frameworks refers to the way many web frameworks structure an application using **Model–View–Controller** to separate data, UI, and logic. This separation keeps code organized, scalable, and maintainable.

**Model**
Represents the data layer and business logic. It interacts with the database and manages rules, validations, and data structures.
Example: User model storing user information.

**View**
Represents the presentation layer. It displays data from the Model to the user using templates (HTML, CSS).
Example: A webpage showing a list of users.

**Controller**
Handles user input and requests. It communicates with the Model, processes data, and selects which View to render.
Example: A controller method reading form data and saving it to the database.

**How MVC Works in Web Frameworks**

1. User sends a request (e.g., clicking a button).
2. Controller receives the request and calls the required Model function.
3. Model processes data (fetch, update, validate).
4. Controller sends processed data to the View.
5. View generates the final webpage and sends it to the user.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
User → Controller → Model → View → User
```

**Examples in Web Frameworks**

* Express.js: `routes → controllers → models → views`
* Django: `urls → views → models → templates`
* Ruby on Rails: `controllers → models → views`

**Applications**

* Web apps needing clean structure
* REST APIs
* E-commerce, dashboards, admin panels

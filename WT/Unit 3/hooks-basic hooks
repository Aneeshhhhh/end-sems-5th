**Definition**
Basic Hooks in React are built-in functions that let functional components use state, lifecycle features, and other React capabilities without writing class components.

**Types (Basic Hooks)**

1. **useState** – manages component state
2. **useEffect** – handles side effects (API calls, timers)
3. **useContext** – accesses global data from Context API

**Working**
Hooks run inside functional components. React keeps track of their values between renders.

* `useState` stores and updates values
* `useEffect` runs after render or when dependencies change
* `useContext` reads context value directly

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Component
 ├── useState → State value + setState
 ├── useEffect → Side effects after render
 └── useContext → Global shared data
```

**Advantages**

* No need for class components
* Cleaner, simpler code
* Easy state management
* Better reusability with custom hooks

**Disadvantages**

* Must follow Rules of Hooks
* Incorrect dependency handling causes bugs
* Overuse of effects may affect performance

**Examples**

**useState:**

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

**useEffect:**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Rendered");
}, []);
```

**useContext:**

```jsx
const user = useContext(UserContext);
```

**Applications**

* Managing UI state
* Fetching data
* Reading global values
* Component lifecycle handling

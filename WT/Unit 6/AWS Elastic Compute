**Definition**
AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable virtual machines (instances) for running applications in the cloud.

**Types**

* **General Purpose:** t2, t3, m5.
* **Compute Optimized:** c5, c6g.
* **Memory Optimized:** r5, x1e.
* **Storage Optimized:** i3, d2.
* **Accelerated Computing:** p3, g4.

**Working**
EC2 provisions virtual servers on demand. Users choose instance type, OS, storage, and network settings, launch the instance, and scale resources up or down as required.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
User → Launch Request
     → EC2 Instance (CPU, RAM, Storage)
     → VPC + Security Groups
     → Application Running
```

**Advantages**

* Highly scalable compute.
* Wide selection of instance types.
* Pay-per-use billing.
* Integrates with all AWS services.
* Flexible configuration.

**Disadvantages**

* Costs rise if instances run continuously.
* Requires configuration and monitoring.
* Security depends on user setup.

**Examples**

* Hosting backend servers.
* Running machine learning inference.
* Deploying microservices.

**Short code snippets**
Launch EC2 instance:

```
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-123456 --instance-type t2.micro
```

Stop instance:

```
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-123456
```

Connect via SSH:

```
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@ec2-public-ip
```

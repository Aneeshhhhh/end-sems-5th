**Definition**
Components of a VPC are the essential networking elements used to design and control a virtual network in AWS.

**Types**

* Subnets
* Route Tables
* Internet Gateway (IGW)
* NAT Gateway
* Security Groups (SG)
* Network ACLs (NACLs)
* DHCP Options Set
* VPC Peering / Transit Gateway
* Elastic IP
* ENI (Elastic Network Interface)

**Working**
Each component manages part of the network: subnets divide IP ranges, gateways control external access, route tables define traffic flow, and SG/NACLs secure traffic.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
VPC
 ├── Subnets (Public / Private)
 ├── Route Tables
 ├── IGW / NAT
 ├── Security Groups
 ├── NACLs
 └── ENIs, Elastic IPs
```

**Advantages**

* Modular and flexible network design.
* Fine-grained traffic control.
* Scalable for any architecture.

**Disadvantages**

* Misconfigurations can break connectivity.
* NAT/Transit Gateway add cost.
* Complex for beginners.

**Examples**

* A public subnet for web servers + private subnet for database.
* A VPC using IGW for internet-facing apps and NAT for private workloads.

**Short code snippets**
List components:

```
aws ec2 describe-vpcs
aws ec2 describe-subnets
aws ec2 describe-route-tables
```

**Applications**

* Building secure multi-tier architectures.
* Designing isolated networks for dev/stage/prod.
* Hosting scalable EC2 + RDS workloads.

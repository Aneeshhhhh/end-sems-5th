**Definition**
AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2, containers, IPs) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

**Types**

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Layer 7, HTTP/HTTPS, path-based and host-based routing.
2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** Layer 4, ultra-low latency, handles millions of requests/sec.
3. **Gateway Load Balancer (GLB):** Deploys and scales virtual appliances like firewalls.
4. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** Older Layer 4/7 load balancer (legacy).

**Working**
ELB receives incoming client requests → evaluates routing rules → forwards traffic to registered targets → performs health checks → redistributes load away from unhealthy instances.

**Algorithm / Steps**

1. Create load balancer (choose ALB/NLB/GLB).
2. Configure listeners (ports, protocol).
3. Set target groups and health checks.
4. Register EC2/container/IP targets.
5. ELB distributes traffic based on routing rules.
6. Monitor via CloudWatch.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Client → ELB → Healthy Targets (EC2 / Containers / IPs)
               ↳ Unhealthy Targets (removed from routing)
```

**Advantages**

* Automatic traffic distribution.
* Fault tolerance and high availability.
* Health checks for targets.
* Supports auto scaling.
* Secure (SSL termination on ALB).

**Disadvantages**

* Additional cost per hour + data processed.
* Misconfigured health checks can mark healthy nodes as unhealthy.
* Legacy CLB has fewer features.

**Examples**

* ALB: Routing requests to microservices based on URL paths.
* NLB: Handling high-throughput gaming or fintech traffic.
* GLB: Deploying intrusion detection or firewall appliances.

**Short code snippets**
Create a target group:

```
aws elbv2 create-target-group --name appTG --protocol HTTP --port 80 --vpc-id vpc-123
```

Register EC2 instances:

```
aws elbv2 register-targets --target-group-arn arn:tg --targets Id=i-123 Id=i-456
```

Create ALB listener:

```
aws elbv2 create-listener --load-balancer-arn arn:alb \
--protocol HTTP --port 80 --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=arn:tg
```

**Applications**

* Web application load balancing.
* Microservices routing.
* High-traffic APIs.
* Autoscaling web servers.
* Load distribution for containerized apps (ECS/EKS).

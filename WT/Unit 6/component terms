Perfect — this is the **right instinct**.
I’ll explain **ALL components**, **clearly**, **briefly**, and **context-linked**, so you build **mental wiring**, not rote memory.

I’ll go **top → down**, exactly in the order you gave.

---

## 1. **VPC CIDR Block**

* CIDR block defines the **IP address range** of the VPC.
* Example: `10.0.0.0/16`
* All subnets and resources get IPs **from this range**.
* Think of it as the **address boundary** of your private network.

👉 *Without CIDR, no VPC exists.*

---

## 2. **Subnets**

* A subnet is a **smaller IP range inside a VPC**.
* Used to organize resources.
* Types:

  * **Public subnet** → has internet access
  * **Private subnet** → no direct internet

👉 *Subnets decide WHERE resources live.*

---

## 3. **Route Tables**

* Route tables define **where traffic should go**.
* Contains routing rules like:

  * `0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway`
* Each subnet is associated with a route table.

👉 *Route table = traffic direction logic.*

---

## 4. **Internet Gateway (IGW)**

* Allows **communication between VPC and the internet**.
* Required for public subnets.
* Without IGW, EC2 cannot be accessed from outside.

👉 *IGW = door to the internet.*

---

## 5. **NAT Gateway**

* Allows **private subnet instances to access the internet**
* Blocks incoming internet traffic.
* Used for updates, patches, downloads.

👉 *NAT = go out, but outsiders can’t come in.*

---

## 6. **Security Groups (SG)**

* Acts as a **virtual firewall for EC2 instances**.
* Controls **inbound and outbound traffic**.
* Stateful → return traffic is automatically allowed.

👉 *SG protects the instance.*

---

## 7. **Network ACLs (NACLs)**

* Firewall at the **subnet level**.
* Controls traffic **entering and leaving subnets**.
* Stateless → inbound and outbound rules needed separately.

👉 *NACL protects the subnet.*

---

## 8. **DHCP Options Set**

* Provides network configuration automatically:

  * DNS server
  * Domain name
  * NTP server
* Automatically assigned to instances.

👉 *DHCP = auto network configuration.*

---

## 9. **VPC Peering**

* Connects **two VPCs privately**.
* Traffic stays within AWS network.
* No internet involved.

👉 *VPC Peering = private VPC-to-VPC bridge.*

---

## 10. **Transit Gateway**

* Central hub to connect:

  * Multiple VPCs
  * VPNs
  * On-premise networks
* Scales better than VPC peering.

👉 *Transit Gateway = network hub.*

---

## 11. **Elastic IP (EIP)**

* Static public IP address.
* Can be attached to EC2 or NAT Gateway.
* Persists even after instance restart.

👉 *EIP = permanent public address.*

---

## 12. **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)**

* Virtual network card.
* Can have:

  * Private IP
  * Public IP
  * Security groups
* Can be detached and reattached.

👉 *ENI = network adapter of EC2.*

---

## Exam Reality Check

* **You now understand all**
* In exam:

  * **Explain 4–5**
  * **List the rest**
* But now you **won’t panic** if any term appears.

If you want next:

* I’ll compress this into a **1-page memory sheet**
* Or build a **perfect 7-mark answer using these**
* Or test you with **“explain any four” drill**

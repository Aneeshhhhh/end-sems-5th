**Definition**
AWS Cloud is Amazon’s on-demand cloud computing platform offering scalable infrastructure services such as compute, storage, databases, networking, and deployment tools.

**Types**

* **IaaS:** EC2, S3, VPC.
* **PaaS:** Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, Lambda.
* **SaaS:** AWS-managed applications like Amazon Chime, WorkMail.

**Working**
AWS provides virtualized resources from distributed data centers. Users allocate compute, storage, and networking on demand and pay only for consumption.

**Algorithm / Steps**

1. Create AWS account.
2. Configure IAM users and permissions.
3. Choose service (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.).
4. Provision resources (instance type, storage, region).
5. Deploy application.
6. Monitor via CloudWatch.
7. Scale using Auto Scaling / Load Balancer.
8. Secure using IAM, VPC, Security Groups.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
User → IAM Auth → AWS Service Request
     → Compute (EC2)
     → Storage (S3/EBS)
     → Database (RDS/DynamoDB)
     → Networking (VPC)
```

**Advantages**

* Scalable and elastic.
* Pay-as-you-use pricing.
* Global availability zones.
* Managed security and compliance.
* Fast deployment.

**Disadvantages**

* Cost increases with scale if unmanaged.
* Vendor lock-in.
* Requires cloud knowledge to optimize.
* Latency depends on region.

**Examples**

* Hosting a website using EC2 + S3 + Route 53.
* Deploying a serverless backend using Lambda + API Gateway.
* Storing large files in S3 buckets.

**Short code snippets**
EC2 instance (AWS CLI):

```
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-123456 \
--instance-type t2.micro --key-name myKey
```

Upload to S3:

```
aws s3 cp file.txt s3://mybucket/
```

Lambda function (Node.js):

```js
exports.handler = async () => {
  return "Hello from Lambda";
};
```

**Definition**
npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js used to install, update, publish, and manage external libraries and dependencies for Node applications.

**Types**

* **Local packages** (installed inside a project)
* **Global packages** (installed system-wide)
* **Dev dependencies**
* **Production dependencies**

**Working**
npm downloads packages from the npm registry and stores them in the `node_modules` folder. It tracks all dependencies in `package.json`, allowing easy version control and management. Developers use commands like `npm install` to fetch libraries and integrate them into their project.

**Advantages**

* Huge ecosystem of packages
* Easy dependency management
* Automates version control for libraries
* Supports package scripts for running tasks

**Disadvantages**

* Too many dependencies can bloat projects
* Version conflicts may occur
* Requires internet for package installation

**Examples**
Install a package:

```bash
npm install express
```

Initialize a project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

**Short code snippets**
Run a script:

```bash
npm run start
```

Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

**Applications**

* Managing Node.js libraries
* Running build tools
* Installing frameworks (Express, React)
* Automating scripts and workflows

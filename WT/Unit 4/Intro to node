**Definition**
Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime built on Google’s V8 engine that enables executing JavaScript outside the browser to build scalable, high-performance network applications.

**Types**

* Server-side applications
* Real-time applications (chat, games)
* API services (REST, GraphQL)

**Working**
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Instead of creating multiple threads, it handles many simultaneous requests using a single-threaded event loop, making it highly efficient for I/O-heavy tasks.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Client Requests
      ↓
Event Loop → Non-blocking I/O → Callback/Promise

 Response
```

**Advantages**

* Fast execution using V8 engine
* Handles many connections efficiently
* Large npm ecosystem
* Lightweight and scalable
* Ideal for APIs and real-time apps

**Disadvantages**

* Not ideal for CPU-heavy tasks
* Callback nesting (mitigated by Promises/async-await)
* Single-threaded limitations

**Examples**
Simple Node.js server:

```js
const http = require("http");

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end("Hello from Node.js");
}).listen(3000);
```

**Short code snippets**

```bash
node app.js
```

**Applications**

* REST APIs
* Chat applications
* Streaming services
* Microservices
* Real-time collaborative tools

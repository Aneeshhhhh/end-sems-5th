Express.js acts as a middleware-based framework, meaning every incoming request passes through a sequence of functions before producing a response. Middleware functions can read or modify the request, perform validation, log activity, handle authentication, or terminate the response. This layered approach makes Express flexible, modular, and easy to extend.

**Types of Middleware**

* **Application-level middleware:** Added using `app.use()`, used for logging, parsing, authentication.
* **Router-level middleware:** Attached to `express.Router()` for grouping routes.
* **Built-in middleware:** Provided by Express (e.g., `express.json()`, `express.urlencoded()`).
* **Third-party middleware:** Installed via npm (e.g., `cors`, `morgan`, `body-parser`).
* **Error-handling middleware:** Special functions with four parameters `(err, req, res, next)` used to catch and manage errors.

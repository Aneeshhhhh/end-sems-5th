**Definition**
Built-in modules in Node.js are core modules provided by the Node runtime that can be used without installation. They offer essential functionalities like file handling, networking, streams, buffers, and utilities.

**Types**

* File system modules
* Networking modules
* Utility modules
* OS and process modules

**Working**
They are loaded using `require("<module>")` and provide synchronous or asynchronous APIs. Node binds these modules to its event-driven architecture for efficient I/O operations.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Node.js Core
 ├── fs
 ├── http
 ├── path
 ├── os
 ├── events
 ├── util
 └── others
```

**Advantages**

* No installation needed
* Optimized for performance
* Reliable and maintained by Node.js
* Deep OS and network integration

**Disadvantages**

* Lower-level APIs require experience
* Some modules are verbose without wrappers

**Examples**

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const http = require("http");
```

**Short code snippets**

```js
const os = require("os");
console.log(os.platform());
```

**Applications**

* Servers (http, https)
* File handling (fs)
* Path operations (path)
* Event-driven logic (events)
* System info tools (os)

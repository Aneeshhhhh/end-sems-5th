**Definition**
Advanced MongoDB refers to higher-level features used for performance, scalability, analytics, and complex querying beyond basic CRUD. These include aggregation pipelines, indexing, replication, sharding, transactions, and advanced operators.

**Types**

* Aggregation Framework
* Indexing
* Replication (Replica Sets)
* Sharding (Horizontal Scaling)
* Transactions
* Advanced Query Operators

**Working**
MongoDB enhances data processing through aggregation pipelines, improves read/write speed using indexes, ensures high availability via replica sets, and distributes data across multiple servers using sharding. Transactions allow multi-document ACID operations, while advanced operators enrich querying capabilities.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
            ┌── Indexes
MongoDB ────┤
            ├── Aggregation Pipeline → Results
            ├── Replica Set → High Availability
            └── Sharding → Horizontal Scaling
```

**Advantages**

* Handles big data efficiently
* High availability via replication
* Scales horizontally with sharding
* Complex analytics using aggregation
* Faster queries through indexing
* Supports ACID transactions

**Disadvantages**

* Sharding adds operational complexity
* Poorly designed indexes may slow writes
* Aggregations can be heavy on memory

**Examples**
Aggregation:

```js
db.sales.aggregate([
  { $match: { amount: { $gt: 1000 } } },
  { $group: { _id: "$category", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
]);
```

Create index:

```js
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 });
```

Replica set initiation:

```js
rs.initiate();
```

**Short code snippets**
Sharding enable:

```js
sh.enableSharding("mydb");
```

Transaction example:

```js
session.startTransaction();
```

**Applications**

* Big data analytics
* High-traffic applications
* Real-time dashboards
* Distributed systems
* Financial apps requiring transactions

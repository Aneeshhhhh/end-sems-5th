**Definition**
Session authentication is a method where the server creates and stores a session for a logged-in user, then sends a session ID to the client. The client includes this session ID in every request to stay authenticated.

**Types**

* In-memory sessions
* File-based sessions
* Database-backed sessions (Redis, MongoDB)

**Working**
When a user logs in, the server verifies credentials and generates a unique session ID. This ID is stored on the server and sent to the client as a cookie. For every subsequent request, the browser automatically sends the cookie. The server checks the session store; if the session is valid, the user is considered authenticated.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Login → Server creates session → Sends sessionID cookie
Client → Sends cookie → Server validates session → Access granted
```

**Advantages**

* Simple and widely used
* Secure when paired with HTTPS
* Server can easily invalidate sessions
* Works well for traditional web apps

**Disadvantages**

* Server must store session data
* Not ideal for distributed systems without shared storage
* Cookies can be stolen if not secured properly

**Examples**
Express session setup:

```js
const session = require("express-session");

app.use(session({
  secret: "key",
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true
}));
```

**Short code snippets**
Set session:

```js
req.session.user = { id: 1, name: "Aneesh" };
```

Check session:

```js
if (req.session.user) { /* authenticated */ }
```

**Applications**

* Login systems
* E-commerce carts
* Admin dashboards
* Any stateful web application

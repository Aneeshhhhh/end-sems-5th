**Definition**
NoSQL refers to non-relational databases designed for flexible schemas, horizontal scaling, and handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document database that stores data in JSON-like BSON documents.

**Types**

* Key–value stores
* Document stores (MongoDB)
* Column-family stores
* Graph databases

**Working**
NoSQL databases avoid fixed tables. MongoDB stores data as collections of documents. Each document contains key–value pairs and can have different fields. CRUD operations are performed using queries like `find()`, `insertOne()`, or `updateOne()`. Data is replicated and sharded for high scalability.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
Database
 └── Collection
       └── Document
             ├── key: value
             └── key: value
```

**Advantages**

* Flexible schema
* High scalability and performance
* Handles large, unstructured datasets
* Easy to integrate with modern apps

**Disadvantages**

* No strict ACID transactions (limited)
* Not ideal for complex joins
* Schema flexibility can lead to inconsistency

**Examples**
Insert document:

```js
db.users.insertOne({ name: "Aneesh", age: 20 });
```

Find document:

```js
db.users.find({ age: 20 });
```

**Short code snippets**
Connect using Node.js:

```js
const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");
MongoClient.connect(url);
```

**Applications**

* Real-time apps
* Content management
* IoT data storage
* Big data analytics
* User profiles & session storage

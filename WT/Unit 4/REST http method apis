REST HTTP method APIs define how clients interact with server resources using standard HTTP verbs. Each method represents a specific action on a resource, making RESTful APIs predictable and easy to use. REST focuses on stateless communication, meaning every request contains all the information needed without relying on server memory.

**Common REST HTTP Methods**

* **GET** – Retrieves data from the server. Used for reading resources.
* **POST** – Sends new data to the server. Used for creating resources.
* **PUT** – Updates or replaces an existing resource entirely.
* **PATCH** – Partially updates an existing resource.
* **DELETE** – Removes a resource from the server.

Example routes in Express:

```js
app.get("/users", getUsers);
app.post("/users", addUser);
app.put("/users/:id", updateUser);
app.delete("/users/:id", deleteUser);
```

REST APIs provide a structured and clean way to perform CRUD operations and are widely used for backend services, mobile applications, and microservices.

**Definition**
Node.js events are asynchronous signals emitted by objects to indicate that something has happened. These events trigger listener functions registered using the EventEmitter module.

**Types**

* Custom events
* Built-in events (e.g., stream events, server events)
* Error events
* Timer events

**Working**
Node.js uses an **EventEmitter** class. When an event is emitted using `.emit()`, all functions registered with `.on()` for that event are executed. This drives Node’s event-driven, non-blocking architecture.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
EventEmitter
   ├── on("event", listener)
   └── emit("event") → listener executes
```

**Advantages**

* Enables asynchronous programming
* Reduces thread usage
* Efficient for I/O-heavy tasks
* Supports modular application design

**Disadvantages**

* Harder debugging for complex event chains
* Mismanaged listeners can cause memory leaks

**Examples**

```js
const EventEmitter = require("events");
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on("greet", () => {
  console.log("Hello!");
});

emitter.emit("greet");
```

**Short code snippets**

```js
emitter.on("data", (msg) => console.log(msg));
```

**Applications**

* Handling HTTP requests
* Streams and file operations
* Real-time apps (chat, notifications)
* Custom event-driven modules

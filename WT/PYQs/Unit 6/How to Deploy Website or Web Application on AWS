**Definition**
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated virtual network in AWS where you define IP ranges, subnets, routing, and security to run cloud resources securely.

**Types**

* Default VPC
* Custom VPC
* Public Subnet
* Private Subnet
* Hybrid VPC (VPN/Direct Connect)

**Working**
A VPC acts as your private data center inside AWS. You define a CIDR block, create subnets, attach gateways, configure route tables, and secure traffic using security groups and NACLs. Resources like EC2, RDS, and Load Balancers run inside this network.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
 ├── Public Subnet  → Internet Gateway
 ├── Private Subnet → NAT Gateway
 ├── Route Tables
 ├── Security Groups
 └── NACLs, ENI, Elastic IP
```

**Advantages**

* Full control over network configuration
* High security and isolation
* Supports hybrid cloud setups
* Scalable and flexible architecture

**Disadvantages**

* Complex for beginners
* NAT/Transit Gateways add cost
* Misconfigurations can block access

**Examples**

* Hosting a 2-tier application (web in public subnet, DB in private)
* Isolated VPC for testing and staging
* Secure backend microservices

**Short code snippets**
Create a VPC:

```
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16
```

Create a subnet:

```
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-123 --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/24
```

**Applications**

* Deploying EC2 and RDS securely
* Running microservices architectures
* Building hybrid networks

# **Components of VPC (Explained)**

**1. Subnets**
Subsections of a VPC divided by IP ranges.

* Public subnets allow internet access (via IGW).
* Private subnets isolate internal resources like databases.

**2. Route Tables**
Define how traffic moves inside/outside the VPC through routing rules (e.g., to IGW, NAT, TGW).

**3. Internet Gateway (IGW)**
Enables outbound and inbound internet access for resources in public subnets.

**4. NAT Gateway**
Allows **private subnet** instances to access the internet (updates, downloads) without exposing them publicly.

**5. Security Groups (SGs)**
Instance-level firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic; stateful.

**6. Network ACLs (NACLs)**
Subnet-level firewalls controlling traffic; stateless; optional extra layer of security.

**7. DHCP Options Set**
Manages DNS servers, NTP servers, and domain names for VPC-based instances.

**8. Elastic IP (EIP)**
Static public IP for EC2 instances for stable internet access.

**9. Elastic Network Interface (ENI)**
Virtual network interface card attached to EC2 instances.

**10. VPC Peering / Transit Gateway**
Connects multiple VPCs together for inter-VPC communication.

If you want, I can also explain **VPC routing**, **public vs private subnets**, or **security groups vs NACLs**.

**Definition**
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that automatically handles deployment, scaling, and monitoring of applications without requiring manual server setup.

**Types**

* Web Server Environments (Node.js, Java, Python, PHP, .NET, Go, Ruby).
* Worker Environments (background tasks).

**Working**
Elastic Beanstalk provisions EC2, Load Balancer, Auto Scaling, Security Groups, and environment variables automatically. You upload your application code, and Beanstalk manages deployment and scaling.

**Steps**

1. Prepare your application folder (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java WAR).
2. Open **Elastic Beanstalk Console** → Create Application.
3. Choose **Platform** (e.g., Node.js, Python).
4. Upload your application code as a ZIP file.
5. Elastic Beanstalk launches environment:

   * EC2 instance
   * Security Groups
   * Auto Scaling
   * Load Balancer
   * CloudWatch monitoring
6. Wait for health status = “**OK**”.
7. Access the app using the provided **Beanstalk URL**:

   ```
   http://<app-name>.elasticbeanstalk.com
   ```

**Diagrams (text)**

```
User → Elastic Beanstalk → EB Environment
                          ├── EC2
                          ├── Load Balancer
                          ├── Auto Scaling
                          └── CloudWatch
```

**Advantages**

* No server setup required.
* Automatic scaling and load balancing.
* Supports many programming languages.
* Fast deployment.
* Integrated monitoring.

**Disadvantages**

* Less control over infrastructure.
* Debugging environment issues can be harder.
* Environment updates may cause downtime.

**Examples**
Deploying a Node.js app:

```
zip app.zip package.json index.js
eb init
eb create my-env
eb deploy
```

**Short code snippets**
Install EB CLI:

```
pip install awsebcli
```

Create environment:

```
eb create my-env
```

Deploy:

```
eb deploy
```

**Applications**

* Hosting full-stack web apps
* Deploying REST APIs
* Auto-scaled production workloads
* Quick test environments for developers

**Definition**
AWS storage services provide scalable, durable cloud-based storage for objects, files, and block data used by applications and workloads.

**Types**

* **Amazon S3** – Object storage
* **Amazon EBS** – Block storage for EC2
* **Amazon EFS** – Managed shared file system
* **Amazon Glacier / Glacier Deep Archive** – Archival storage
* **AWS Storage Gateway** – Hybrid on-prem + cloud storage
* **Amazon FSx** – High-performance file systems (Windows, Lustre)
* **AWS Backup** – Centralized backup solution

**Working**
Each service handles a different storage need: S3 stores objects in buckets, EBS attaches as block volumes to EC2, EFS provides scalable shared file storage, and Glacier archives data for long-term retention.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
AWS Storage
 ├── S3 (Object)
 ├── EBS (Block → EC2)
 ├── EFS (File → Multi-EC2)
 ├── Glacier (Archive)
 ├── FSx (Specialized FS)
 └── Storage Gateway (Hybrid)
```

**Advantages**

* Highly durable and scalable
* Multiple storage classes
* Integrated with AWS compute and databases
* Pay-as-you-use
* Automated lifecycle policies

**Disadvantages**

* Costs increase with heavy usage
* Misusing storage type reduces performance
* Data transfer charges may apply

**Examples**

* Store images/videos in S3
* Use EBS for EC2 OS disks
* Use EFS for shared backend storage
* Use Glacier for long-term logs and backups

**Short code snippets**
Create S3 bucket:

```
aws s3 mb s3://mybucket
```

Upload file:

```
aws s3 cp file.txt s3://mybucket/
```

Create EBS volume:

```
aws ec2 create-volume --size 20 --availability-zone us-east-1a
```

**Applications**

* Web app content storage
* EC2 persistent volumes
* Shared storage for microservices
* Archival backups and compliance data

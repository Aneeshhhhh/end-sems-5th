# **Components of AWS VPC (Explained in Brief but Proper Exam Depth)**

An Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) consists of several networking components that together form a customizable and secure cloud network. The main components are as follows:

---

## **1. Subnets**

Subnets divide the VPC’s IP address range into smaller logical sections.
They are of two types:

* **Public Subnet:** Connected to the Internet Gateway; used for web servers.
* **Private Subnet:** No direct internet access; used for databases or internal services.
  Subnets allow better organization, isolation, and routing control inside the VPC.

---

## **2. Route Tables**

A route table contains rules (routes) that determine how traffic is directed within the VPC.
Each subnet must be associated with a route table.
For example, a route table for a public subnet contains a route pointing to the Internet Gateway, while private subnets may route traffic to a NAT Gateway.

---

## **3. Internet Gateway (IGW)**

The Internet Gateway enables communication between the VPC and the internet.
It is attached to the VPC and provides a target for public route tables, allowing EC2 instances in public subnets to send/receive data from the internet.

---

## **4. NAT Gateway**

A NAT Gateway allows instances in private subnets to access the internet **without being exposed to it**.
It is typically used for downloading updates, accessing APIs, etc., while keeping instances secure.

---

## **5. Security Groups**

Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for instances.
They control **inbound and outbound traffic**, are stateful, and apply directly to EC2 instances.
They are used to allow only permitted access (e.g., SSH, HTTP, HTTPS).

---

## **6. Network ACLs (NACLs)**

Network ACLs provide subnet-level security.
They are stateless and apply rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.
They offer an additional security layer on top of Security Groups.

---

## **7. Elastic IP Addresses (EIP)**

Elastic IPs are static public IPv4 addresses provided by AWS.
They are useful when a consistent IP address is required, such as hosting a public-facing server.

---

## **8. Elastic Network Interface (ENI)**

ENIs are virtual network cards attached to EC2 instances.
They support multiple private IPs, public IPs, and security groups.
They help achieve high availability and failover setups.

---

## **9. DHCP Options Set**

Specifies DNS servers, domain name, and NTP servers for instances within the VPC.
By default, AWS provides Amazon DNS, but custom settings can be applied.

---

## **10. VPC Peering & Transit Gateway**

* **VPC Peering:** Connects two VPCs for private communication.
* **Transit Gateway:** Central hub that connects multiple VPCs and on-prem networks efficiently.

**Definition**
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is an isolated virtual network in AWS where you control IP ranges, subnets, routing, and security for cloud resources.

**Types (Components List)**

* VPC CIDR Block
* Subnets
* Route Tables
* Internet Gateway (IGW)
* NAT Gateway
* Security Groups (SG)
* Network ACLs (NACLs)
* DHCP Options Set
* VPC Peering
* Transit Gateway
* Elastic IP
* Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

**Working**
A VPC provides a customizable network. You define CIDR, create subnets, attach gateways, configure routing, and secure traffic using SGs and NACLs.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
 ├── Public Subnet → IGW
 ├── Private Subnet → NAT
 ├── Route Tables
 ├── SGs & NACLs
 └── ENIs, Elastic IPs
```

**Advantages**

* Full network control
* High security
* Supports hybrid connectivity
* Scalable architecture

**Disadvantages**

* Can be complex
* NAT Gateway/Transit costs
* Misconfigurations break connectivity

**Examples**

* Hosting a 2-tier web application
* Creating isolated dev/prod networks
* Secure backend databases in private subnets

**Short code snippets**
Create VPC:

```
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16
```

Create subnet:

```
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-123 --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/24
```

**Applications**

* Deploying EC2 and RDS in secure networks
* Hosting microservices
* Hybrid cloud networking

### **Explanation of any four components**

**1. Subnets**
Logical subdivisions of a VPC.

* **Public subnet:** Internet access via IGW
* **Private subnet:** Internal-only resources (DBs)

**2. Internet Gateway (IGW)**
Allows communication between VPC and the internet. Required for public subnets.

**3. Route Tables**
Define how traffic moves within the VPC.
Entries decide whether packets go to IGW, NAT, or remain internal.

**4. Security Groups (SGs)**
Virtual firewalls attached to instances controlling **inbound/outbound** traffic.
Stateful → return traffic is automatically allowed.

You can replace any with NAT Gateway, NACLs, ENI, or Peering if needed.

**Definition**
PuTTY is a free SSH client used to remotely access Linux-based EC2 instances from Windows.

**Working**
PuTTY establishes an encrypted SSH session using a private key (.ppk) to authenticate with the EC2 instance.

**Steps**

1. Open **PuTTYgen** → Load your `.pem` key → Save as `.ppk`.
2. Open **PuTTY**.
3. Enter the **EC2 Public IPv4** in “Host Name”.
4. Go to **Connection → SSH → Auth** → Browse → Select `.ppk`.
5. Click **Open** → Login as `ec2-user` / `ubuntu`.

**Advantages**

* Lightweight and easy to use.
* Supports SSH, telnet, serial.
* Works well for EC2 remote access.

**Disadvantages**

* Requires conversion from `.pem` to `.ppk`.
* Windows-only (native).

**Examples**
Connecting to Amazon Linux using:

```
Host: ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute.amazonaws.com
User: ec2-user
```

**Short code snippets**
SSH equivalent command:

```
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@ec2-public-ip
```

**Applications**

* Logging into EC2 instances.
* Managing remote Linux servers.
* Running commands and deployments.

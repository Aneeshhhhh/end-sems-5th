**Definition**
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is an AWS service that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

**Types**

* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** – Layer 7, HTTP/HTTPS routing.
* **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** – Layer 4, high-performance TCP/UDP routing.
* **Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)** – Deploys and scales virtual appliances.
* **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** – Older Layer 4/7 load balancer.

**Working**
ELB receives incoming client requests and evenly routes them to healthy backend instances. It performs health checks, removes unhealthy instances automatically, and scales traffic handling dynamically.

```

**Advantages**

* High availability
* Automatic failover
* Scalable traffic handling
* Integrated health checks
* Supports HTTPS termination

**Disadvantages**

* Adds cost
* Misconfiguration can block traffic
* CLB has limited features

**Examples**

* ALB routing `/api` and `/app` to different EC2 groups
* NLB handling millions of TCP connections

**Short code snippets**
Create target group:

```
aws elbv2 create-target-group --name mytg --protocol HTTP --port 80
```

Register instance:

```
aws elbv2 register-targets --target-group-arn arn... --targets Id=i-123456
```

**Applications**

* Web application load distribution
* Microservices routing
* Auto Scaling architectures
* High-traffic APIs

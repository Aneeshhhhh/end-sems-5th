**Definition**
AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud where you control IP ranges, subnets, routing, and security to host AWS resources.

---

**Types**

* Default VPC
* Custom VPC
* Public Subnet
* Private Subnet
* Hybrid VPC (VPN / Direct Connect)
* Peered VPC

---

**Working**
A VPC is created by defining an IP range (CIDR). You divide it into public/private subnets, attach gateways for internet or NAT access, assign route tables to manage traffic flow, and secure resources using Security Groups and Network ACLs.

**Diagrams (text)**

```
VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
 ├── Public Subnet → IGW
 ├── Private Subnet → NAT
 ├── Route Table
 ├── Security Groups
 ├── NACLs
 └── ENIs, Elastic IP
```

---

**Advantages**

* Full control over network configuration
* High security with SG and NACLs
* Supports hybrid architectures
* Isolation between environments
* Scalable for any workload

---

**Disadvantages**

* Complex for beginners
* NAT Gateways / Transit Gateway add cost
* Misconfiguration can break connectivity

---

**Examples**

* A 2-tier architecture: public EC2 + private RDS
* Microservices separated into multiple subnets
* Secure backend systems without internet access

---

**Short code snippets**
Create VPC:

```
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16
```

List VPC components:

```
aws ec2 describe-vpcs
aws ec2 describe-subnets
aws ec2 describe-route-tables
```

**Applications**

* Hosting secure applications
* Deploying multi-tier architectures
* Running isolated environments (dev/prod)
* Hybrid on-prem + cloud networking

# **Components of VPC (Explanation)**

### **1. Subnets**

Logical subdivisions of a VPC.

* **Public subnets** connect to the internet via IGW.
* **Private subnets** run internal resources like databases.

### **2. Route Tables**

Control how traffic flows inside the VPC.
Each subnet is associated with one route table.

### **3. Internet Gateway (IGW)**

Enables internet access for resources in public subnets.

### **4. NAT Gateway**

Allows private subnets to access the internet **outbound** without exposing them publicly.

### **5. Security Groups (SGs)**

Instance-level firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
Stateful—return traffic is automatically allowed.

### **6. Network ACLs (NACLs)**

Subnet-level firewalls controlling traffic in and out.
Stateless—rules must be explicitly defined for both directions.

### **7. Elastic IP**

Static public IP used for EC2 instances or NAT Gateways.

### **8. Elastic Network Interface (ENI)**

Virtual network interface attached to EC2 instances.

### **9. DHCP Options Set**

Provides DNS and DHCP settings to instances inside the VPC.

### **10. VPC Peering / Transit Gateway**

Used for connecting VPCs to each other or to on-prem networks.

Amazon VPC consists of several core components that together form a customizable virtual network environment.

**Subnets:**
Logical divisions of the VPC IP range. Public subnets connect to the internet via an Internet Gateway, while private subnets keep resources internal.

**Route Tables:**
Contain routing rules that determine where traffic from each subnet is directed. Public route tables send traffic to the IGW; private ones may route to a NAT Gateway.

**Internet Gateway (IGW):**
Allows public subnets and their resources to access the internet. It must be attached to the VPC and referenced in route tables.

**NAT Gateway:**
Enables private instances to access the internet for updates or API calls without exposing them publicly.

**Security Groups:**
Stateful firewalls attached to EC2 instances. They control inbound and outbound traffic and allow only explicitly permitted connections.

**Network ACLs (NACLs):**
Subnet-level stateless firewalls that filter traffic entering or leaving a subnet. Provide an additional security layer beyond Security Groups.

**Elastic IP:**
Static public IPv4 addresses used when a consistent public IP is required for a server.

**Elastic Network Interface (ENI):**
Virtual network cards attached to EC2 instances. Support multiple IPs, security groups, and allow failover configurations.

**DHCP Options Set:**
Defines DNS servers, domain names, and NTP servers for instances launched within the VPC.

**VPC Peering / Transit Gateway:**
VPC Peering connects two VPCs for private communication. Transit Gateway connects multiple VPCs and on-prem networks through a centralized hub.

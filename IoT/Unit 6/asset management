**Definition**
Managing, tracking, monitoring, and optimizing physical assets using IoT sensors, connectivity, and analytics.

**Types**

* **Fixed asset management** – machines, buildings, equipment.
* **Mobile asset management** – vehicles, tools, shipments.
* **IT asset management** – servers, networking devices.
* **Infrastructure asset management** – pipelines, power grids.

**Working / Steps**

1. Attach IoT sensors (RFID, GPS, temperature, vibration).
2. Sensor collects real-time data.
3. Data sent to gateway → cloud platform.
4. System performs analytics (location, usage, condition).
5. Dashboard displays asset status; alerts triggered if anomalies.
6. Users take decisions (maintenance, allocation, replacement).

**Advantages**

* Real-time tracking
* Reduced losses/theft
* Predictive maintenance
* Improved asset utilization
* Lower operational cost

**Disadvantages**

* High initial deployment cost
* Requires network availability
* Data security risks
* Sensor maintenance overhead

**Examples**

* Tracking construction equipment
* Monitoring factory machines
* Fleet management using GPS IoT
* Smart warehouse inventory

**Short Code Snippet (relevant: MQTT publish example)**

```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
client = mqtt.Client()
client.connect("broker.hivemq.com", 1883)
client.publish("asset/tracker", "{'id':101, 'temp':32.4, 'loc':'12.91,77.60'}")
```

**Applications**

* Manufacturing (machine health)
* Logistics (vehicle tracking)
* Healthcare (medical equipment tracking)
* Retail (inventory management)
* Smart cities (public asset monitoring)

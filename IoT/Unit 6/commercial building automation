**Definition**
Commercial Building Automation refers to using IoT sensors, controllers, and a Building Management System (BMS) to automatically control HVAC, lighting, security, elevators, and energy systems in commercial buildings.

**Types**

* **HVAC automation**
* **Lighting automation**
* **Security & access control**
* **Energy management systems**
* **Fire & safety automation**

**Working / Steps**

1. Sensors measure temperature, occupancy, light levels, air quality.
2. Data sent to controllers and BMS.
3. BMS decides actions: adjust AC, dim lights, lock doors, trigger alarms.
4. Actuators execute changes.
5. Cloud/BMS dashboard shows real-time building status.

**Advantages**

* Reduced energy consumption
* Enhanced occupant comfort
* Improved security
* Predictive maintenance
* Centralized control

**Disadvantages**

* High installation cost
* Integration complexity
* Cybersecurity risks
* Requires skilled staff

**Examples**

* Motion-based lighting
* Smart access control systems
* Fire detection and suppression automation

**Applications**

* Office buildings
* Malls
* Hotels
* Hospitals
* Airports

**Short Note (Exam-ready)**
Commercial building automation uses IoT-enabled sensors and a BMS to monitor and control HVAC, lighting, security, and energy systems. It reduces energy usage, improves comfort, enhances safety, and allows centralized, intelligent management of large commercial buildings.

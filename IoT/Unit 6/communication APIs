**Definition**
Communication APIs are software interfaces that enable IoT devices, gateways, and cloud applications to communicate by sending, receiving, and managing data using standardized protocols.

**Types**

* **REST APIs** (HTTP-based)
* **MQTT APIs** (publish–subscribe messaging)
* **CoAP APIs** (lightweight constrained devices)
* **WebSocket APIs** (full-duplex communication)
* **BLE/GATT APIs** (Bluetooth communication)
* **Vendor IoT APIs** (AWS IoT, Azure IoT, Google IoT APIs)

**Working / Steps**

1. IoT device collects data.
2. Communication API formats the message (JSON, binary).
3. API sends data through a supported protocol (HTTP/MQTT/CoAP).
4. Cloud/server receives and processes the message.
5. API enables commands or responses back to the device.

**Advantages**

* Standardized communication
* Interoperability across devices
* Simplifies IoT application development
* Supports real-time data transfer
* Scalable for large deployments

**Disadvantages**

* Requires network availability
* Overhead for constrained devices (REST)
* Security risks if not encrypted
* Protocol compatibility issues

**Examples**

* Sending sensor data through an MQTT API
* REST API to fetch device status
* WebSocket API for live monitoring
* CoAP API in low-power devices

**Applications**

* Smart home device control
* Industrial sensor data streaming
* Remote monitoring dashboards
* Healthcare IoT communication
* Smart city infrastructure systems

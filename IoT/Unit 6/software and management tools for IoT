**Definition**
IoT cloud storage models define how IoT data is stored, managed, and accessed in cloud environments based on requirements like latency, volume, security, and processing needs.

**Types**

* **Public Cloud Storage**
* **Private Cloud Storage**
* **Hybrid Cloud Storage**
* **Multi-cloud Storage**
* **Fog/Edge-connected Cloud Storage**
* **Time-series Database Storage** (specialized for IoT sensor data)

**Working / Steps**

1. IoT devices generate continuous data streams.
2. Gateways or edge devices preprocess data.
3. Data is transmitted securely to the cloud storage model selected.
4. Cloud stores data in object storage, block storage, or time-series DBs.
5. Analytics tools access stored data for visualization and decision-making.
6. Applications interact with cloud APIs for retrieval and updates.

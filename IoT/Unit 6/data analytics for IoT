**Definition**
Data analytics for IoT is the process of collecting, cleaning, processing, and analyzing sensor-generated data to extract insights, detect patterns, make predictions, and support real-time decision-making.

**Types**

* **Descriptive analytics** – summarizes past IoT data.
* **Diagnostic analytics** – identifies causes of events.
* **Predictive analytics** – forecasts future outcomes using ML.
* **Prescriptive analytics** – recommends actions.
* **Real-time/stream analytics** – processes live sensor data.

**Working / Steps**

1. **Data acquisition:** Sensors generate raw data.
2. **Preprocessing:** Filtering, cleaning, normalization.
3. **Data storage:** Cloud, distributed systems, time-series databases.
4. **Analytics engine:** Statistical, ML, or stream-processing algorithms.
5. **Visualization:** Dashboards and alerts.
6. **Decision/Action:** Automated control or user decisions.

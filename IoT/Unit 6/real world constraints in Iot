* **Resource Constraints**

  * Limited CPU, memory, and storage in IoT devices
  * Low battery capacity requiring energy-efficient protocols
  * Restricted computation at the edge

* **Network Constraints**

  * Low bandwidth and unreliable connectivity
  * High latency for remote cloud communication
  * Use of heterogeneous protocols (WiFi, Zigbee, LoRa) complicates communication

* **Scalability Constraints**

  * Large number of devices generating massive data
  * Need for scalable storage and processing
  * Device management becomes complex at scale

* **Security Constraints**

  * Weak encryption due to resource limits
  * Vulnerability to attacks (spoofing, jamming, MITM)
  * Difficulty in secure authentication and firmware updates

* **Privacy Constraints**

  * Sensitive personal/environmental data collection
  * Risk of unauthorized access or misuse
  * Need for strong data protection policies

* **Environmental Constraints**

  * Extreme temperature, humidity, dust, vibration
  * Physical damage affecting sensor accuracy
  * Outdoor deployment issues (weather, corrosion)

* **Interoperability Constraints**

  * Multiple vendors and incompatible standards
  * Difficulty in integrating old and new devices
  * Need for middleware or common data models

* **Cost Constraints**

  * High deployment and maintenance cost
  * Connectivity and cloud storage expenses
  * Replacement/repair cost for devices

* **Regulatory Constraints**

  * Compliance with data protection laws (GDPR)
  * Spectrum regulations for wireless communication

* **Usability Constraints**

  * Limited user expertise for configuring devices
  * Complex interfaces for monitoring and maintenance

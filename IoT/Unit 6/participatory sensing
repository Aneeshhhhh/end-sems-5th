**Definition**
Participatory sensing is a method where individuals use their smartphones or IoT devices to collect, share, and contribute data about their environment for large-scale sensing applications.

**Types**

* **Opportunistic sensing** (automatic data collection without user intervention)
* **Participatory (explicit) sensing** (user actively captures data)
* **Community-based sensing** (group of people contribute to a common goal)
* **Personal sensing** (self-monitoring: health, fitness)

**Working / Steps**

1. Users carry smartphones with sensors (GPS, camera, accelerometer, mic).
2. They capture or allow automatic collection of environmental data.
3. Data is uploaded to a cloud platform.
4. System aggregates, filters, and analyzes crowd data.
5. Results are visualized for public, researchers, or authorities.

**Advantages**

* Low cost (uses existing devices)
* Large-scale, real-time data
* Community involvement
* High geographic coverage

**Disadvantages**

* Privacy concerns
* Data quality varies
* User participation inconsistency
* Battery and network usage

**Examples**

* Pollution monitoring apps

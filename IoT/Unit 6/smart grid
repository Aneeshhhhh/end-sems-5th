**Definition**
A smart grid is an electricity network that uses IoT sensors, communication technologies, and analytics to monitor, control, and optimize power generation, transmission, and distribution in real time.

**Types**

* **Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)**
* **Smart distribution grid**
* **Smart transmission grid**
* **Microgrids**
* **Renewable-integrated grids**

**Working / Steps**

1. Smart meters/sensors measure voltage, load, frequency, and consumption.
2. IoT communication (RF, Zigbee, LTE, PLC) sends data to utility control centers.
3. Analytics detect faults, demand patterns, and overloads.
4. Automated control systems adjust supply, reroute power, or balance loads.
5. Consumers receive real-time usage data for demand-side management.
6. Integration with renewables ensures stable and optimized energy flow.

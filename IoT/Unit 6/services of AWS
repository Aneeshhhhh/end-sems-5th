**Definition**
AWS provides a wide range of cloud services for computing, storage, networking, databases, analytics, security, IoT, and application deployment to support scalable and reliable cloud-based systems.

**Types (Major Categories of AWS Services)**

* **Compute Services** (EC2, Lambda, ECS)
* **Storage Services** (S3, EBS, Glacier)
* **Database Services** (RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora)
* **Networking Services** (VPC, Route 53, CloudFront)
* **Analytics Services** (Athena, EMR, Kinesis)
* **Machine Learning Services** (SageMaker)
* **Security Services** (IAM, KMS, Shield)
* **Management & Monitoring** (CloudWatch, CloudTrail)
* **IoT Services** (AWS IoT Core, IoT Analytics, IoT Greengrass)
* **Developer Tools** (CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline)

**Working / Steps**

1. Users select AWS services through the console or API.
2. Resources are provisioned on demand (compute, storage, databases).
3. AWS manages scaling, availability, and infrastructure.
4. Integrated services communicate with each other (e.g., IoT Core → Lambda → DynamoDB).
5. Users monitor and secure services using IAM, CloudWatch, and VPC.

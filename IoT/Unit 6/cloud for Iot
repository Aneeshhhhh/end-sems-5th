**Definition**
Cloud for IoT refers to using cloud platforms to store, process, analyze, and manage the massive data generated by IoT devices, while providing services like device management, security, application hosting, and real-time analytics.

**Types**

* **Public cloud** (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
* **Private cloud** (enterprise-owned)
* **Hybrid cloud** (mix of public + private)
* **Multi-cloud** (multiple vendors)
* **Edge–cloud integration** (processing split between edge and cloud)

**Working / Steps**

1. IoT devices generate continuous sensor data.
2. Gateways/edge devices preprocess data (filtering, aggregation).
3. Data is securely transmitted to the cloud via APIs/protocols.
4. Cloud services store the data (object, block, time-series DBs).
5. Analytics engines and ML tools analyze patterns in real time.
6. Cloud dashboards visualize insights.
7. Cloud sends control commands or alerts back to devices.

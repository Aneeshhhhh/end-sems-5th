**Definition**
AWS for IoT is Amazon’s cloud platform that provides services for connecting, managing, securing, processing, and analyzing IoT devices and their data at scale.

**Types (Core AWS IoT Services)**

* **AWS IoT Core** – device connectivity & messaging
* **AWS IoT Device Management** – provisioning, monitoring, updates
* **AWS IoT Analytics** – large-scale data processing
* **AWS IoT Greengrass** – edge computing
* **AWS IoT Device Defender** – security & auditing
* **AWS IoT Events** – event detection
* **AWS IoT SiteWise** – industrial IoT data modeling

**Working / Steps**

1. IoT devices connect to AWS IoT Core using MQTT/HTTP/WebSockets.
2. Devices publish data to cloud topics.
3. AWS services store data (S3, DynamoDB), process data (Lambda, Analytics), or forward it to ML tools.
4. Device Management handles monitoring, fleet management, and OTA updates.
5. AWS Greengrass enables edge processing when cloud latency is not acceptable.
6. Dashboards and applications access processed data for real-time decisions.

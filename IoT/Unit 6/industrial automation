**Definition**
Use of IoT devices, sensors, controllers, and networks to automate industrial processes with minimal human intervention.

**Types**

* **Process automation** (chemical, oil, pharma)
* **Factory automation** (assembly lines, robotics)
* **Building automation** (HVAC, lighting)
* **Safety automation** (fault detection, alarms)

**Working / Steps**

1. Sensors collect data (temperature, pressure, vibration).
2. IoT devices send data to controllers (PLC, SCADA, IoT gateways).
3. Controllers analyze and execute actions (switch ON/OFF, adjust speed).
4. Data forwarded to cloud for monitoring and analytics.
5. System triggers alerts and optimizes processes in real time.

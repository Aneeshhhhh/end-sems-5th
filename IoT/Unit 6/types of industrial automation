**Definition**
Types of industrial automation classify how industries automate processes using machines, controllers, and IoT technologies to improve productivity, accuracy, and efficiency.

**Types**

1. **Fixed (Hard) Automation**

   * Designed for high-volume, repetitive tasks.
   * Machinery is fixed and cannot be easily changed.
   * Example: automated assembly lines.

2. **Programmable Automation**

   * Equipment can be reprogrammed for different product batches.
   * Suitable for batch production.
   * Example: CNC machines.

3. **Flexible (Soft) Automation**

   * Rapid changeover between products with minimal reconfiguration.
   * Supports varied product ranges.
   * Example: robotic cells.

4. **Integrated Automation**

   * Fully automated system combining PLCs, SCADA, robotics, IoT, and analytics.
   * End-to-end automation from design to production.

**Working / Steps**

1. Sensors collect real-time data.
2. Controllers (PLC, DCS) process inputs.
3. Actuators perform required actions.
4. Systems communicate via industrial networks.
5. Monitoring and supervision through SCADA/MES.

* Lower operational cost
* Supports continuous operation

**Disadvantages**

* High initial investment
* Requires skilled workforce
* Maintenance complexity
* Risk of job displacement

**Examples**

* Car manufacturing robots
* Packaging automation
* Conveyor belt systems
* Automated welding and painting

**Applications**

* Automotive manufacturing
* Food processing
* Pharmaceuticals
* Electronics production
* Chemical industries

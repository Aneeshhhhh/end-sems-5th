**Definition**
A Data Acquisition System (DAQ) is a system that collects, digitizes, processes, and stores physical-world signals from sensors for monitoring, analysis, and control.

## **Types**

* **Analog DAQ systems**
* **Digital DAQ systems**
* **Hybrid (Analog + Digital)**
* **PC-based DAQ**
* **Embedded DAQ modules**

## **Working / Steps**

1. **Sensors** measure physical quantities (temp, pressure, vibration).
2. **Signal Conditioning** amplifies, filters, and prepares signals.
3. **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)** converts analog signals to digital.
4. **DAQ Hardware** collects and packages data.
5. **Processor/Computer** stores, visualizes, and analyzes data.
6. Data is used for control, monitoring, or automation.

## **Advantages**

* Accurate and fast data collection
* Easy monitoring and control
* Supports real-time automation
* Integrates with software tools for analysis
* Converts raw physical signals into usable digital data

---

## **Disadvantages**

* Can be expensive for high-precision setups
* Sensitive to noise and interference
* Requires calibration and proper configuration
* Limited by ADC resolution and sampling rate

---

## **Examples**

* Temperature/humidity logging systems
* Vibration monitoring in machines
* ECG/EEG medical data acquisition
* Industrial sensor data collection
* Environmental monitoring stations

---

## **Applications**

* Industrial automation
* Healthcare monitoring
* Smart agriculture
* Scientific research
* Environmental sensing
* Automotive testing

### **Short Note (Points)**

* DAQ collects and digitizes sensor data using conditioning + ADC.
* Components: **sensor → signal conditioning → ADC → DAQ unit → computer**.
* Used in industry, healthcare, labs, agriculture, and monitoring systems.

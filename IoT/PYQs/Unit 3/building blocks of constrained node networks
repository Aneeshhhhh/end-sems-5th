**Definition**
Building blocks of constrained node networks are the essential components that enable communication, routing, addressing, and data handling in networks made of low-power, low-memory IoT devices.

## **Types (Core Building Blocks)**

1. **Constrained Nodes**
2. **Constrained Networks / Links**
3. **Adaptation Layer (6LoWPAN)**
4. **Routing Protocol (RPL)**
5. **Transport Protocols (UDP/TCP-lite)**
6. **Application Protocols (CoAP, MQTT-SN)**
7. **Security Mechanisms (DTLS, AES)**
8. **Gateways / Border Routers**

---

## **Working / Steps**

1. **Constrained nodes** sense and generate small data packets.
2. **Low-power networks** (IEEE 802.15.4, BLE, LoRa) transmit data.
3. **6LoWPAN layer** compresses IPv6 headers and fragments packets.
4. **RPL routing** organizes nodes into a low-power mesh (DODAG).
5. **UDP-based transport** carries lightweight messages.
6. **CoAP/MQTT-SN** provide application-level communication.
7. **Security** added using DTLS, AES-128.
8. **Border router/gateway** connects constrained network to the Internet.

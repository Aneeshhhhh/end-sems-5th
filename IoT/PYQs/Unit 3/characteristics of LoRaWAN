## **Types (Categories of Characteristics)**

* **Network Characteristics**
* **Communication Characteristics**
* **Security Characteristics**
* **Device Operation Characteristics**

---

## **Working / Steps**

1. End devices send LoRa-modulated uplink to gateways.
2. Gateways forward data to the network server.
3. Network server handles deduplication, ADR, and security.
4. Application server provides data to user applications.
5. Device class (A/B/C) decides downlink behavior and energy usage.

## **Characteristics of LoRaWAN**

### **1. Long-Range Communication**

* Up to **10–15 km** rural, 2–5 km urban.

### **2. Low Power Consumption**

* Devices can last **years on batteries**.
* Class A devices sleep most of the time.

### **3. Low Data Rate**

* Suitable for small sensor payloads.
* Data rates from **0.3 kbps to 50 kbps**.

### **4. Star-of-Stars Topology**

* End devices connect to multiple gateways.

### **5. Operates on Unlicensed ISM Bands**

* 433 MHz, 868 MHz, 915 MHz.

### **6. Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)**

* Optimizes data rate and power based on distance.

### **7. Supports Multiple Device Classes**

* Class A – ultra-low power
* Class B – scheduled receive windows
* Class C – continuous receive

### **8. Bi-Directional Communication**

* Uplink + downlink support.

### **9. Strong Security Layers**

* **AES-128 encryption** (end-to-end).
* Network key + application key.

### **10. Scalability**

* Supports **thousands of end devices** per gateway.

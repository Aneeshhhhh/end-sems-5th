**Definition**
LoRaWAN architecture defines the network structure used for long-range, low-power IoT communication. It uses a **star-of-stars** topology with end devices communicating to gateways, which forward data to centralized network servers.

## **Types (Core Components)**

* **End Devices (Sensors/Nodes)**
* **LoRa Gateways**
* **Network Server**
* **Application Server**
* **Join Server** (for authentication/security)

---

## **Working / Steps**

1. **End devices** send LoRa-modulated uplink messages.
2. Nearby **gateways** receive messages and forward them via IP to the Network Server.
3. The **Network Server** handles:

   * Deduplication (same packet from multiple gateways)
   * Security checks
   * Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)
   * Routing to the Application Server
4. **Application Server** decodes payload for user applications.
5. **Downlink** messages (commands) are sent back to devices through gateways.

## **Characteristics**

* Star-of-stars topology
* Long-range, low-power communication
* AES-128 security (network + app keys)
* Supports Classes A, B, C
* Payloads are small (few bytes)

---

## **Advantages**

* Very long communication range
* Battery life of years
* Highly scalable (thousands of nodes)
* Secure end-to-end communication
* Low infrastructure cost

---

## **Disadvantages**

* Very low data rate
* High latency
* Payload size is small
* Not suitable for real-time systems

---

## **Examples**

* Smart meter networks
* Smart irrigation
* Air quality monitoring
* Asset tracking

---

## **Applications**

* Smart cities
* Agriculture IoT
* Utility metering
* Industrial monitoring
* Environmental sensing

### **Short Note (Points)**

* LoRaWAN uses **star-of-stars** with **end devices → gateways → network server → application server**.
* Provides **long-range, low-power** communication.
* Uses **AES-128**, ADR, and supports device classes A/B/C.
* Ideal for smart city, agriculture, metering, and environmental IoT.

**Definition**
Levels of an IoT system are architectural layers defined by Cisco to describe how IoT devices, networks, data, and applications interact from sensing to business processes. There are **6 levels**, each adding functionality and intelligence.

---

## **Types (6 Levels of IoT Architecture)**

1. **Level 1 – Smart Objects (Sensors/Actuators)**
2. **Level 2 – Connectivity (Communication Network)**
3. **Level 3 – Edge Computing (Fog Layer / Data Accumulation)**
4. **Level 4 – Data Abstraction (Data Organization & Access)**
5. **Level 5 – Application Layer (Apps & Analytics)**
6. **Level 6 – Collaboration & Processes (Business Processes)**

---

## **Working / Steps**

### **Level 1 – Smart Objects**

Devices sense, measure, or act on physical parameters.

### **Level 2 – Connectivity**

Data travels over Wi-Fi, LoRa, Zigbee, 5G, etc.

### **Level 3 – Edge Computing / Data Accumulation**

Gateways filter and preprocess data to reduce cloud load.

### **Level 4 – Data Abstraction**

Data stored, indexed, secured, and made accessible through APIs.

### **Level 5 – Application Layer**

Dashboards, analytics, alarms, and control systems operate.

### **Level 6 – Collaboration & Processes (Explain Level 6)**

* Integrates IoT insights into **business workflows**.
* Automates decisions (e.g., maintenance scheduling, alerts).
* Human operators, enterprise systems, and IoT apps collaborate.
* Enables end-to-end system automation and optimization.
* Supports enterprise tools (ERP, M2M communication, analytics-driven actions).

## **Advantages**

* Clear functional separation
* Scalable and modular architecture
* Integrates IoT with enterprise decision-making
* Supports automation and real-time analytics
* Enables end-to-end IoT system design

---

## **Disadvantages**

* Complex to implement fully
* Requires strong integration between levels
* Cost increases with advanced levels
* Needs sophisticated data management

---

## **Examples**

* Smart factory integrating IoT analytics with ERP
* Smart city traffic system linking sensors to municipal operations
* Agriculture IoT triggering automated irrigation
* Healthcare IoT connecting devices to hospital workflow systems

---

## **Applications**

* Industry 4.0
* Smart cities
* Healthcare automation
* Energy and utility management
* Transportation and logistics

### **Short Note (Points)**

* IoT has **6 levels**: devices, connectivity, edge computing, data abstraction, applications, business processes.
* **Level 6** integrates IoT output with **enterprise workflows** for automation and decision-making.
* Ensures collaboration between machines, apps, and humans.

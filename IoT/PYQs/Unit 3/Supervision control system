**Definition**
A Supervisory Control System is a system used to monitor, supervise, and control industrial processes from a central location using sensors, controllers, and operator interfaces.

---

## **Types**

* **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)**
* **DCS (Distributed Control System)**
* **PLC-based Supervisory Systems**
* **IoT-enabled Supervisory Systems**

---

## **Working / Steps**

1. **Sensors** measure process variables (temperature, pressure, flow).
2. **PLCs/RTUs** collect data and execute control logic.
3. Data is sent to a **supervisory computer/server**.
4. Operator views real-time data on HMI dashboards.
5. Operator or automated logic sends commands → actuators perform actions.
6. System logs events, alarms, and performance data.

## **Advantages**

* Centralized monitoring and control
* Real-time decision-making
* Reduces human error and increases safety
* Enables automation of complex processes
* Supports alarms, logging, and fault detection

---

## **Disadvantages**

* High installation and maintenance cost
* Vulnerable to cyberattacks if not secured
* Complex to configure and integrate
* PLC/RTU failures can disrupt process

---

## **Examples**

* Power plant control
* Oil and gas pipelines
* Water treatment and distribution
* Manufacturing assembly lines

---

## **Applications**

* Industrial automation
* Energy and utilities
* Smart city infrastructure
* Transportation systems

### **Short Note (Points)**

* Supervisory control systems monitor and control industrial processes.
* Use **sensors → PLC/RTU → supervisory server → HMI**.
* Provide real-time supervision, alarms, and automation.
* Applied in power, manufacturing, water treatment, and smart infrastructure.

**Definition**
Tools used in data analytics are software platforms that help collect, clean, process, visualize, and analyze large-scale IoT or enterprise data to extract insights and support decision-making.

**Types**

* **Data Processing Tools** – Hadoop, Spark
* **Visualization Tools** – Power BI, Tableau
* **Statistical/ML Tools** – Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), R
* **Streaming Analytics Tools** – Kafka, AWS Kinesis
* **Cloud Analytics Tools** – AWS IoT Analytics, Azure Synapse, Google BigQuery
* **Database/Query Tools** – SQL, NoSQL, Time-series DBs (InfluxDB)

**Working / Steps**

1. Tools ingest raw data from sensors, logs, databases, or streams.
2. Preprocessing tools clean and format the data.
3. Processing engines run queries, ML models, or transformations.
4. Analytics platforms store results and generate insights.
5. Visualization tools convert insights into charts and dashboards.

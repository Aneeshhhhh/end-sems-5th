**Definition**
Best practices for securing data at rest are methods used to protect stored data from unauthorized access, theft, or tampering through encryption, access control, and secure storage mechanisms.

**Types**

* **Encryption methods** (AES-256, RSA)
* **Access control methods** (RBAC, IAM)
* **Hardware-based protection** (HSM, TPM)
* **Data integrity methods** (hashing, checksums)

**Working / Steps**

1. Identify sensitive data requiring protection.
2. Encrypt data using strong algorithms before storage.
3. Store encryption keys separately using KMS or HSM.
4. Apply strict access policies (least privilege).
5. Enable audit logging and monitoring.
6. Rotate keys and credentials periodically.
7. Backup encrypted data securely.

**Advantages**

* Prevents unauthorized access
* Meets compliance requirements
* Protects data even if storage is stolen
* Enhances overall security posture

**Disadvantages**

* Encryption adds processing overhead
* Key management is complex
* Misconfiguration can expose data
* Requires skilled administration

**Examples**

* Encrypting IoT logs in AWS S3 using SSE-KMS
* Using AES-256 for device-generated sensor files
* Storing medical data in encrypted databases
* HSM-based key storage for industrial IoT systems

**Applications**

* IoT cloud storage security
* Enterprise databases
* Healthcare and finance data systems
* Smart grids and critical infrastructure

### **Short Note (Points)**

* Encrypt data at rest using strong algorithms.
* Use separate key management (KMS/HSM).
* Apply least-privilege access control.
* Enable logging and integrity checks.
* Rotate keys regularly and secure backups.

**Definition**
The core components of an IoT framework are the essential building blocks that enable device connectivity, data handling, processing, and application-level functionality in an IoT system.

**Types / Four Components**

1. **Device Layer (Sensors & Actuators)**
2. **Network/Communication Layer**
3. **Data Processing Layer (Edge/Cloud)**
4. **Application Layer**

**Working / Steps**

1. **Device Layer:** Sensors collect data; actuators perform actions.
2. **Network Layer:** Transfers data using MQTT, CoAP, WiFi, LoRa, etc.
3. **Data Processing Layer:** Edge/cloud performs filtering, analytics, storage.
4. **Application Layer:** Dashboards, automation, alerts, and user interfaces use processed data.

**Advantages**

* Clear separation of IoT functions
* Enhances scalability and modularity
* Enables standardized communication
* Supports analytics and automation

**Disadvantages**

* Integration across layers can be complex
* Security must be managed at each layer
* Performance issues if one layer is weak

**Examples**

* Device → Temperature sensor
* Network → MQTT over WiFi
* Processing → AWS IoT Analytics
* Application → Smart home mobile app

**Applications**

* Smart cities
* Smart homes
* Industrial IoT
* Healthcare IoT
* Agriculture automation

### **Short Note (Points)**

* Four components: **Device layer, Network layer, Data processing layer, Application layer**.
* Devices collect data → Network transmits → Processing analyzes → Apps visualize/control.
* Forms the basic architecture for any IoT system.

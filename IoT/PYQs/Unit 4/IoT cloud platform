**Definition**
An IoT cloud platform is a cloud-based service that provides tools for connecting, managing, storing, processing, and analyzing IoT device data while enabling remote control, automation, and application development.

**Types**

* **Device Management Platforms** – AWS IoT Core, Azure IoT Hub
* **Data Analytics Platforms** – AWS IoT Analytics, BigQuery
* **Edge–Cloud Platforms** – AWS Greengrass, Azure IoT Edge
* **Application Enablement Platforms (AEPs)** – ThingWorx, Kaa
* **Specialized IoT Cloud Platforms** – IBM Watson IoT, Cisco Kinetic

**Working / Steps**

1. IoT devices connect to cloud using MQTT/HTTP/CoAP.
2. Cloud authenticates devices and establishes secure communication.
3. Data is ingested into messaging pipelines or storage.
4. Analytics engines process data (real-time + historical).
5. Cloud triggers actions or sends commands to devices.
6. Applications use APIs and dashboards for monitoring and control.

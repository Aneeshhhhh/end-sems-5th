**Definition**
A data warehouse is a centralized, structured storage system designed for querying, reporting, and analyzing historical data collected from multiple sources.

**Types**

* **Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)**
* **Operational Data Store (ODS)**
* **Data Marts**
* **Cloud Data Warehouses** (BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake)

**Working / Steps**

1. Data is extracted from IoT systems, apps, and databases.
2. ETL/ELT processes transform and clean the data.
3. Structured data is loaded into warehouse tables.
4. Users run queries, dashboards, and reports.
5. Warehouse supports analytics, trends, and decision-making.

* Strong consistency and governance

**Disadvantages**

* Not suitable for unstructured data
* Expensive for very large datasets
* Slower ingestion compared to data lakes
* Requires predefined schema (schema-on-write)

**Examples**

* Amazon Redshift
* Google BigQuery
* Snowflake
* Microsoft Azure Synapse

**Applications**

* Business intelligence
* Sales forecasting
* IoT trend analysis
* Enterprise reporting
* KPI monitoring

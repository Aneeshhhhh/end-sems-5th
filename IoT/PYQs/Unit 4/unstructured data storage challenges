**Definition**
Unstructured data storage challenges refer to the difficulties faced when storing, managing, indexing, and retrieving non-tabular IoT data such as images, audio, video, logs, and documents.

**Types (Challenges Categories)**

* **Storage challenges**
* **Management challenges**
* **Processing challenges**
* **Security challenges**
* **Retrieval challenges**

**Working / Steps (How challenges arise)**

1. IoT devices generate large, irregular data (videos, logs).
2. Data formats lack a fixed schema, making indexing hard.
3. Storage grows rapidly, exceeding device/cloud limits.
4. Metadata creation becomes necessary for retrieval.
5. Processing and analytics require specialized tools.
6. Security must handle large binary objects separately.

**Advantages**
(N/A — this topic is about challenges, so advantages do not apply.)

**Disadvantages / Challenges**

* Huge storage requirements (video/audio grow rapidly)
* Difficult to index and search without metadata
* Higher cost for cloud object storage
* Hard to maintain data consistency
* Complex backup and disaster recovery
* Requires specialized analytics tools
* Security and privacy issues with large binary objects
* Slow retrieval time compared to structured data
* Data quality issues due to noise, corruption
* Interoperability issues across devices

**Examples**

* CCTV video storage filling cloud buckets quickly
* Smart city audio logs requiring heavy metadata tagging
* Industrial machine images needing large storage arrays
* Wearable device logs causing indexing complexity

**Applications**
(Applies broadly, but examples of challenge-heavy domains:)

* Smart surveillance
* Smart cities
* Industrial inspection systems
* Healthcare imaging
* Autonomous vehicles

### **Short Note (Points)**

* Large file sizes → high storage and cost.
* Hard to index/search unstructured formats.
* Requires metadata for retrieval.
* Complex security and access control.
* Needs specialized tools for analytics.
* Slow retrieval and processing.
* Rapid storage growth → scalability issues.

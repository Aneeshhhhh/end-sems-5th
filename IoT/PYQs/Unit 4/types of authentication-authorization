**Definition**
Types of authentication and authorization refer to the different mechanisms used to verify the identity of users/devices (authentication) and determine their allowed actions (authorization) in an IoT system.

**Types**

### **Authentication Types**

* **Password/PIN-based authentication**
* **Token-based authentication (OAuth, JWT)**
* **Certificate-based authentication (X.509)**
* **Biometric authentication**
* **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
* **Device-level authentication (unique keys, IDs)**

### **Authorization Types**

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – permissions based on roles.
* **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** – based on attributes like device type/location.
* **Policy-Based Authorization** – rules specify allowed actions.
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** – allow/deny lists for resources.

**Working / Steps**

1. **Authentication:** Device/user sends credentials → system verifies identity.
2. **Authorization:** After identity is confirmed → system checks permissions/policies.
3. **Access Granted/Denied:** Only permitted actions (publish, read, write, control) are allowed.

**Advantages**

* Protects IoT systems from unauthorized access
* Granular control over device/user operations
* Enhances overall system security
* Supports scalable and flexible permission management

**Disadvantages**

* Requires careful key and policy management
* Misconfiguration may cause security gaps
* Added overhead for resource-constrained IoT devices

**Examples**

* X.509 certificate authentication for IoT devices
* JWT tokens for API access
* RBAC for industrial IoT machines
* ACL-based topic permissions in MQTT
* MFA for cloud dashboard login

**Applications**

* IoT cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google IoT)
* Smart homes and building automation
* Industrial IoT device control
* Healthcare and wearables
* Smart grids and utilities

### **Short Note (Points)**

* Authentication verifies identity; authorization defines allowed actions.
* Authentication types: passwords, tokens, certificates, MFA, device keys.
* Authorization types: RBAC, ABAC, ACLs, Policy-based control.
* Both are essential for secure IoT deployments.

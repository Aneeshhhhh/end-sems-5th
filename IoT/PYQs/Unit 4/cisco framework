**Definition**
The Cisco IoT Framework is a comprehensive architecture and platform by Cisco that provides networking, security, device management, edge computing, and data analytics capabilities for large-scale IoT deployments.

**Types (Components)**

* **Cisco IoT Network Architecture**
* **Cisco Kinetic IoT Platform**
* **Cisco Fog Computing (IOx)**
* **Cisco Jasper (Connectivity Management)**
* **Cisco Security Architecture for IoT**

**Working / Steps**

1. Devices connect through Cisco gateways/routers using protocols (MQTT, CoAP, Modbus).
2. Cisco Kinetic manages data collection, filtering, and secure transfer.
3. Cisco IOx provides edge/fog computing for local analytics.
4. Cloud connectivity enables centralized monitoring and automation.
5. Cisco security layers enforce authentication, authorization, and threat detection.

**Definition**
Cloud platforms for IoT applications are cloud-based services that provide connectivity, device management, data storage, analytics, and application enablement for building and deploying IoT systems.

**Types (Major IoT Cloud Platforms)**

* **AWS IoT Platform**
* **Microsoft Azure IoT Suite**
* **Google Cloud IoT Platform**
* **IBM Watson IoT Platform**
* **Cisco IoT Cloud (Kinetic, Jasper)**
* **Oracle IoT Cloud**
* **ThingWorx IoT Platform**
* **Kaa IoT Cloud (open-source)**

**Working / Steps**

1. Devices connect using MQTT/HTTP/CoAP.
2. Platform authenticates and manages the devices.
3. Data from devices is ingested into cloud storage.
4. Analytics/ML engines process and visualize data.
5. Applications use APIs to control devices or automate workflows.

**Definition**
Zetta is an open-source, API-driven IoT platform built on Node.js for creating real-time, scalable IoT servers that connect devices, sensors, and cloud services using a REST/JSON and WebSocket architecture.

**Types (Components of Zetta)**

* **Zetta Server** – main runtime environment
* **Zetta Device Drivers** – define device behavior
* **Zetta Scouts** – discover/connect devices automatically
* **Zetta API Layer** – REST + WebSocket interface
* **Zetta Hub / Cloud Integration** – connects multiple Zetta servers

**Working / Steps**

1. Devices are described using **drivers** in Node.js.
2. **Scouts** detect and register devices to the Zetta server.
3. Each device becomes a REST/Hypermedia API automatically.
4. Communication occurs through WebSockets for real-time updates.
5. Multiple Zetta servers form a distributed IoT network (“Zetta hubs”).
6. Apps and dashboards interact with devices via REST/WebSocket APIs.

```

**Advantages**

* API-first architecture for easy integration
* Real-time communication using WebSockets
* Lightweight (Node.js-based) and easy to deploy
* Highly modular with drivers and scouts
* Can create distributed IoT systems with server federation

**Disadvantages**

* Requires Node.js knowledge
* Not as feature-rich as AWS/Azure IoT
* Limited ecosystem and community
* No built-in large-scale analytics

**Examples**

* Smart home device control server
* Real-time monitoring dashboards
* Wearable data streaming
* Small to medium IoT prototypes and systems

**Applications**

* Smart homes
* Real-time IoT dashboards
* Prototyping IoT systems
* Lightweight industrial monitoring
* Education and research projects

### **Short Note (Points)**

* Zetta is an open-source, Node.js-based IoT platform.
* Provides REST + WebSocket APIs automatically for devices.
* Uses drivers + scouts for device modeling and discovery.
* Supports real-time, distributed IoT systems.
* Best for lightweight, API-driven IoT applications.

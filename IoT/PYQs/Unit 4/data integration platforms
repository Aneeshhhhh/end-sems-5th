**Definition**
Data integration platforms are software systems that collect, combine, transform, and unify data from multiple heterogeneous sources (IoT devices, databases, cloud apps, streams) into a consistent and usable format.

**Types**

* **ETL Platforms** – Talend, Informatica, AWS Glue
* **ELT/Big Data Platforms** – Apache Spark, Databricks
* **Streaming Integration Platforms** – Apache NiFi, Kafka Connect
* **Cloud Integration Platforms** – Azure Data Factory, Google Dataflow
* **API-based Integration Platforms** – MuleSoft, Dell Boomi

**Working / Steps**

1. **Extract** data from sensors, devices, APIs, or databases.
2. **Transform** through cleaning, normalization, filtering, enrichment.
3. **Integrate** different data formats into unified datasets.
4. **Load** into storage systems (DBs, data lakes, warehouses).
5. **Orchestrate** workflows for real-time or batch integration.
6. **Provide APIs** for applications and analytics tools to use integrated data.

**Advantages**

* Simplifies handling large, diverse IoT data
* Real-time and batch integration abilities
* Improves data accuracy and consistency
* Automates workflows and pipelines
* Scales easily for massive IoT deployments

**Disadvantages**

* Can be expensive for enterprise tools
* Requires technical skills to configure
* Integration workflows may get complex
* Performance bottlenecks if not optimized

**Examples**

* Apache NiFi for IoT data flows
* AWS Glue for ETL into S3/Data Lake
* Azure Data Factory for pipeline orchestration
* Kafka Connect for real-time stream integration
* MuleSoft for API-based data integration

**Applications**

* IoT analytics and dashboards
* Enterprise data pipelines
* Smart city data unification
* Predictive maintenance systems
* Healthcare and finance data ecosystems

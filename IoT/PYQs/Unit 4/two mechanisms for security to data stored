**Definition**
Security mechanisms for stored data are techniques used to protect data at rest from unauthorized access, modification, or theft.

**Types (Two Main Mechanisms)**

1. **Encryption**
2. **Access Control**

**Working / Steps**

### **1. Encryption**

1. Data is encrypted before being stored.
2. Encryption keys stored separately (KMS/HSM).
3. Only authorized users/devices can decrypt.

### **2. Access Control**

1. User/device authentication occurs first.
2. Authorization policies (RBAC/ACLs) determine who can access data.
3. System enforces least privilege.

**Advantages**

* Strong protection against data theft
* Prevents unauthorized access
* Ensures compliance and data integrity

**Disadvantages**

* Encryption adds computational overhead
* Key management complexity
* Access control misconfigurations can cause breaches

**Examples**

* AES-256 encryption of IoT logs
* RBAC policies in cloud storage
* Device-specific access permissions

**Applications**

* IoT cloud databases
* Healthcare records
* Smart grid data
* Industrial sensor archives

### **Short Note (Points)**

* Two mechanisms: **Encryption** and **Access Control**.
* Encryption protects data even if storage is compromised.
* Access control ensures only authorized users/devices can view or modify data.
* Both together provide strong data-at-rest security.

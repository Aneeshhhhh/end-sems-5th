**Definition**
A data lake is a large, centralized storage repository that holds massive amounts of raw, unprocessed data (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured) in its native format for future analytics and processing.

**Types**

* **Raw Data Lake** – stores data exactly as received.
* **Curated Data Lake** – organized, cleaned, partially processed.
* **Cloud Data Lake** – AWS S3, Azure Data Lake, Google Cloud Storage.
* **Streaming Data Lake** – handles continuous real-time data flows.

**Working / Steps**

1. Data from sensors, devices, logs, apps is ingested into the lake.
2. Stored in raw format (JSON, CSV, video, audio, logs).
3. Metadata/cataloging added for easy discovery.
4. Processing done later using ETL, ML, or analytics tools.
5. Users query or analyze data when needed.

**Advantages**

* Stores any type of data in raw format
* Highly scalable and cost-effective
* Ideal for big data and IoT workloads
* Supports advanced analytics and machine learning
* No need for predefined schema (schema-on-read)

**Disadvantages**

* Can become a “data swamp” if unmanaged
* Requires proper metadata and governance
* Slower queries compared to structured DBs
* Security and access control complexity

**Examples**

* AWS S3 as a cloud data lake
* Azure Data Lake Storage
* Google Cloud Storage for IoT data
* Storing raw CCTV video, sensor logs, mobile app data

**Applications**

* IoT analytics and predictive maintenance
* Big data processing
* AI/ML model training datasets
* Smart city data aggregation
* Healthcare and financial analytics

### **Short Note (Points)**

* Central repository storing raw structured + unstructured data.
* Scalable, low-cost, ideal for IoT and big data.
* Uses schema-on-read and supports ML/analytics.
* Needs strong governance to avoid data swamp issues.

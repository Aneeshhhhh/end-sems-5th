**Definition**
Constrained networks are IoT networks with limited bandwidth, high latency, low data rates, and strict energy and power constraints. They connect constrained nodes using lightweight protocols.

## **Types**

* **Low-Power Wireless Networks** – IEEE 802.15.4, Zigbee, 6LoWPAN
* **LPWAN Networks** – LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, LTE-M
* **Short-Range Networks** – BLE, RFID
* **Duty-Cycled Networks** – nodes sleep most of the time to save power

---

## **Working / Characteristics**

1. Nodes operate on batteries → communication minimized.
2. Use low data rate links (kbps range).
3. Packets are small, infrequent, and energy-efficient.
4. Routing protocols like **RPL** designed for low-power networks.
5. Networks often rely on gateways for cloud connectivity.
6. Use lightweight protocols (CoAP, MQTT-SN) to reduce overhead.

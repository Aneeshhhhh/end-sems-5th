**Definition**
IEEE 802.11ah (Wi-Fi HaLow) is a low-power, long-range Wi-Fi standard designed for IoT. It defines network topologies and strong security mechanisms suitable for large IoT deployments.

---

## **Types**

### **Topologies**

* **Star Topology** (AP-centric)
* **Hierarchical / Grouping Topology** using TIM and RAW
* **Sub-Net / Multi-AP Topology** for large clusters

### **Security Types**

* **WPA3-SAE** (modern, strong Wi-Fi security)
* **AES-128 Encryption**
* **Protected Management Frames (PMF)**
* **EAP-based authentication**
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**

---

## **Working / Steps**

### **Topology Working**

1. Devices connect to an **Access Point (AP)** in star formation.
2. For large IoT networks, AP divides stations into **TIM groups** (Traffic Indication Map).
3. AP allocates **RAW (Restricted Access Window)** to each group to avoid collisions.
4. Multi-AP deployments extend coverage for large sensor networks.

### **Security Working**

1. Device initiates authentication using **WPA3-SAE** handshake.
2. AP verifies identity and establishes a secure session key.
3. All data transmitted using **AES encryption**.
4. **PMF** protects from deauthentication spoofing.
5. ACLs and MAC filtering provide additional control.

 ├── Group 2 (RAW slot 2)
 └── Group 3 (RAW slot 3)
```

### **Security**

```
Device → WPA3-SAE Handshake → Secure Key
       → AES Encryption → Protected Data Channel
```

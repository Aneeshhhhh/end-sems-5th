**Definition**
6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks) is an adaptation layer that allows IPv6 packets to run efficiently on low-power, low-bandwidth IEEE 802.15.4 networks by compressing headers and enabling fragmentation and mesh routing.

## **Types**

* **Header Compression Types**

  * IPv6 Header Compression
  * UDP Header Compression
* **Routing Types**

  * Mesh-under routing
  * Route-over routing (often with RPL)

---

## **Working / Steps**

1. IPv6 packets are too large for 802.15.4 (max 127 bytes).
2. 6LoWPAN **compresses IPv6/UDP headers** to fit small frames.
3. Performs **fragmentation** to split packets into smaller frames.
4. Uses **mesh routing** to forward packets through multiple nodes.
5. At the destination, packets are **reassembled** and delivered as IPv6.
6. Enables seamless communication with the wider internet.

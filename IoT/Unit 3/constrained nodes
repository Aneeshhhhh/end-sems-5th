**Definition**
Constrained nodes are IoT devices with limited processing power, memory, storage, and energy. They operate under strict resource constraints and are designed for low-power, low-cost IoT applications.

## **Types**

* **Class 0 (C0):** Extremely constrained, cannot run full IP stack
* **Class 1 (C1):** Limited resources, can run lightweight IP (6LoWPAN, CoAP)
* **Class 2 (C2):** Moderate resources, can support richer protocols

---

## **Working / Characteristics**

1. Operate on batteries or energy harvesting.
2. Use simple microcontrollers (8-bit/16-bit).
3. Support low-rate communication (LoRa, Zigbee, BLE).
4. Limited ability to process or store data → depend on gateways/cloud.
5. Often sleep most of the time to save power.

## **Advantages**

* Low cost
* Low energy consumption
* Easy deployment in large IoT networks
* Long battery life (months to years)

---

## **Disadvantages**

* Limited memory and processing power
* Cannot run complex security or analytics locally
* Depend heavily on gateways
* Vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured

---

## **Examples**

* Temperature/humidity sensors
* Wearables
* Smart agriculture soil sensors
* Remote environment monitoring nodes
* Simple RFID/NFC tags

---

## **Applications**

* Smart homes
* Environmental monitoring
* Health and fitness devices
* Industrial sensor networks
* Agriculture IoT

---

## **Short Note (Points)**

* Constrained nodes have limited CPU, memory, and power.
* Classified as **C0, C1, C2** based on capability.
* Use low-power protocols (CoAP, 6LoWPAN, BLE, LoRa).
* Depend on gateways for heavy tasks.
* Ideal for large-scale, battery-powered IoT deployments.

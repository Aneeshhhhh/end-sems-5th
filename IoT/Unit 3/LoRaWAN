**Definition**
LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a low-power, long-range wireless communication protocol designed for IoT devices. It operates on unlicensed ISM bands and enables long-distance communication with minimal energy consumption.

## **Types**

* **Class A** – lowest power, bi-directional, uplink-initiated
* **Class B** – scheduled downlink windows
* **Class C** – continuous listening (lowest latency, highest power)

---

## **Working / Steps**

1. IoT devices (end nodes) send data using LoRa modulation.
2. LoRa gateways receive packets and forward them to the Network Server.
3. Network Server filters duplicates, manages security, and routes data.
4. Application Server processes data for user apps.
5. Downlink messages sent via gateway when allowed by device class.

## **Advantages**

* Very long range (up to 10–15 km rural)
* Ultra low power → multi-year battery life
* Operates on unlicensed bands
* Supports thousands of devices
* Simple star-of-stars topology
* Strong security with AES-128

---

## **Disadvantages**

* Low data rates (unsuitable for video or large data)
* Increased latency
* Duty-cycle restrictions in ISM bands
* Not suitable for real-time applications
* Limited payload size (~51 bytes typical)

---

## **Examples**

* Smart metering
* Environmental monitoring sensors
* Smart agriculture soil/moisture sensors
* Asset and livestock tracking
* Smart parking systems

---

## **Applications**

* Smart cities
* Industrial IoT
* Agriculture IoT
* Utility metering (water/gas/electricity)
* Building monitoring
* Logistics and supply chain

---

## **Short Note (Points)**

* LoRaWAN is a **long-range, low-power WAN** protocol for IoT.
* Uses **star-of-stars** topology with gateways and network servers.
* Provides **AES-128 end-to-end security**.
* Classes A, B, C support different power/latency needs.
* Ideal for smart cities, agriculture, metering, and remote sensors.

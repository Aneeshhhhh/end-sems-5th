**Definition**
IoT access technologies are communication methods that allow IoT devices to connect to networks and transmit data to gateways, cloud, or other devices.

**Types**

* **Short-range technologies** – Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi
* **Medium-range technologies** – Wi-Fi HaLow, RFID, NFC
* **Long-range (LPWAN)** – LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, LTE-M
* **Cellular technologies** – 4G, 5G, LTE
* **Wired technologies** – Ethernet, Modbus, CAN bus

**Working / Steps**

1. Device selects access technology based on range, power, and bandwidth needs.
2. Signals transmitted to gateway or network base station.
3. Data routed to cloud for storage and analytics.
4. Device receives commands or updates via the same channel.

**Definition**
The MAC (Medium Access Control) layer controls how multiple IoT devices share and access a common communication medium, ensuring reliable and collision-free data transmission.

**Types**

* **Contended MAC** – CSMA/CA (Wi-Fi), ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA
* **Scheduled MAC** – TDMA, FDMA, CDMA
* **Hybrid MAC** – combination of contention + scheduling (e.g., Zigbee)

**Working / Steps**

1. Determines when a device is allowed to transmit data.
2. Avoids collisions using contention or scheduling methods.
3. Provides addressing (MAC addresses) for devices.
4. Handles frame formatting, error detection, and retransmission.
5. Coordinates access among multiple nodes in a network.

**Advantages**

* Efficient sharing of communication medium
* Reduces collisions and improves reliability
* Supports device addressing and security functions
* Helps manage low-power devices (duty cycling)

**Disadvantages**

* Contention-based MAC suffers in high traffic
* Scheduling requires synchronization
* Overhead may increase energy consumption

**Examples**

* Wi-Fi MAC using CSMA/CA
* Zigbee MAC using CSMA/CA + scheduling
* LoRaWAN MAC using ALOHA
* Cellular MAC based on TDMA/FDMA

**Applications**

* Wireless sensor networks
* Smart homes (Zigbee, Wi-Fi)
* Industrial IoT
* Smart agriculture
* Smart city deployments

### **Short Note (Points)**

* MAC layer manages medium access and prevents collisions.
* Uses CSMA/CA, TDMA, ALOHA, etc.
* Assigns MAC addresses and handles frames.
* Ensures reliable, shared wireless communication in IoT.

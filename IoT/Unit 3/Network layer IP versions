**Definition**
In IoT, the network layer is responsible for routing, addressing, and forwarding data between devices and cloud servers. *Io versions* refers to the different IP versions and adaptations used in IoT networks—primarily **IPv4**, **IPv6**, and **6LoWPAN** (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks).

---

## **Types (Io/Internet Versions Used in IoT)**

* **IPv4** – traditional 32-bit addressing
* **IPv6** – 128-bit addressing, supports massive IoT scaling
* **6LoWPAN** – adaptation layer enabling IPv6 on low-power IoT networks
* **RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power Networks)** – IPv6 routing for IoT
* **IoT-specific IP adaptations** like Thread (based on 6LoWPAN + IPv6)

## **Working / Steps**

### **IPv4**

1. Device assigned a 32-bit IP address.
2. Routes via traditional internet routing.
3. Limited address space → unsuitable for massive IoT.

### **IPv6**

1. Device gets 128-bit globally unique address.
2. Vast address space → supports billions of IoT nodes.
3. Supports auto-configuration and better multicast.

### **6LoWPAN**

1. Compresses IPv6 headers to fit low-power links (IEEE 802.15.4).
2. Enables IP-based communication for tiny IoT devices.
3. Works with mesh topologies via RPL.

## **Advantages**

* **IPv6:** huge address space, auto-configuration, better security
* **6LoWPAN:** allows tiny, low-power devices to use IP
* **Standardization:** easy integration with internet protocols
* **Scalability:** supports millions of IoT devices

---

## **Disadvantages**

* **IPv4:** limited address space
* **IPv6:** not fully adopted everywhere
* **6LoWPAN:** requires adaptation layer, more complex
* **Interoperability issues** when mixed with legacy networks

---

## **Examples**

* Smart homes using IPv6-based Thread protocol
* Industrial sensors running 6LoWPAN on IEEE 802.15.4
* IoT gateways translating 6LoWPAN → IPv6 → Cloud
* Smart meters using IPv6 addressing

---

## **Applications**

* Smart cities
* Smart homes (Thread, Nest, Zigbee IP)
* Industrial IoT
* Environmental sensor networks
* Smart agriculture

---

## **Short Note (Points)**

* IoT uses **IPv4, IPv6, and 6LoWPAN** at the network layer.
* IPv6 provides huge address space for billions of devices.
* 6LoWPAN adapts IPv6 for low-power IEEE 802.15.4 networks.
* RPL provides routing for IPv6-based low-power IoT.
* Ensures scalable, IP-compatible IoT communication.

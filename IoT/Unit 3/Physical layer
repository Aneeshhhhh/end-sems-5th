**Definition**
The physical layer is the lowest layer in IoT communication responsible for transmitting raw bits over a physical medium using electrical, radio, optical, or mechanical signals.

**Types**

* **Wired Physical Layer** – Ethernet, USB, RS-232, CAN
* **Wireless Physical Layer** – Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, NB-IoT, 5G
* **Optical Physical Layer** – Fiber optics
* **RFID/NFC Physical Channel**

**Working / Steps**

1. Converts digital bits into physical signals (electrical, RF, optical).
2. Transmits signals over wired/wireless mediums.
3. Receiver converts signals back into digital bits.
4. Ensures modulation, coding, synchronization, and signal strength.

**Definition**
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight, publish–subscribe messaging protocol designed for low-power IoT devices and unreliable networks. It uses a central message broker to route messages between clients.

## **Types**

* **QoS 0 – At most once**
* **QoS 1 – At least once**
* **QoS 2 – Exactly once**
* **Message Types** – CONNECT, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, DISCONNECT, etc.

## **Working / Steps**

1. Devices connect to an MQTT **broker** (server).
2. A device **publishes** data to a topic.
3. Other devices **subscribe** to topics they care about.
4. Broker forwards messages from publishers to subscribers.
5. QoS levels ensure delivery reliability.
6. Persistent sessions allow offline message handling.

## **Advantages**

* Extremely lightweight → ideal for constrained IoT devices
* Works well on unreliable/low-bandwidth networks
* Supports QoS for reliable messaging
* Asynchronous publish–subscribe model
* Low power usage for battery devices

---

## **Disadvantages**

* Requires a central broker → single point of failure
* No built-in encryption (must use TLS)
* Not suitable for large binary data
* Complex topic hierarchy management

---

## **Examples**

* Sending sensor telemetry to cloud (AWS, Azure IoT)
* Smart home devices publishing status updates
* Industrial machines sending periodic data
* Vehicle tracking systems sending GPS coordinates

---

## **Applications**

* Smart homes
* Industrial IoT monitoring
* Connected vehicles
* Healthcare wearables
* Agriculture IoT

### **Short Note (Points)**

* MQTT is a **publish–subscribe**, broker-based IoT protocol.
* Lightweight, low-bandwidth, ideal for constrained devices.
* Uses QoS 0/1/2 for reliable delivery.
* Needs TLS for secure communication.
* Widely used in IoT clouds and sensor networks.

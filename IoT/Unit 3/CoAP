**Definition**
CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a lightweight, RESTful application-layer protocol designed for constrained IoT devices and networks. It works over UDP and supports low-power, low-bandwidth communication.

---

## **Types**

* **Confirmable Messages (CON)**
* **Non-confirmable Messages (NON)**
* **Acknowledgement (ACK)**
* **Reset (RST)**

---

## **Working / Steps**

1. Follows REST model using **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**.
2. Client sends a request to a CoAP server (device or gateway).
3. Messages sent over **UDP** to reduce overhead.
4. For reliability, **confirmable messages** require ACK from receiver.
5. Supports **Observe** option for continuous updates (publish-like behavior).
6. Responses include payloads in compact binary format.

## **Advantages**

* Lightweight and optimized for constrained nodes
* Low overhead due to UDP
* Supports multicast
* Reliable messaging via CON/ACK
* Works well with 6LoWPAN and low-power WSNs

---

## **Disadvantages**

* UDP may lead to packet loss
* No built-in security unless DTLS is used
* Limited payload size
* Not ideal for high-throughput applications

---

## **Examples**

* Smart home sensors communicating with gateways
* Environmental monitoring devices
* CoAP-based actuators (lights, thermostats)
* IoT networks using 6LoWPAN

---

## **Applications**

* Smart homes and buildings
* Industrial sensor networks
* Smart agriculture
* Healthcare monitoring
* Environmental sensing

### **Short Note (Points)**

* CoAP is a lightweight RESTful protocol for constrained IoT.
* Uses **UDP**, supports **GET/POST/PUT/DELETE**, and has **CON/NON/ACK**.
* Works with **6LoWPAN** and low-power networks.
* Suitable for sensors and actuators in resource-limited environments.

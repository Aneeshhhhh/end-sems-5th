**Definition**
IEEE 802.15.4 defines the physical and MAC layers for low-power, low-data-rate wireless networks used in IoT. It specifies network topologies and built-in security mechanisms for reliable and safe communication.

### **Types**

#### **Topologies**

* **Star Topology**
* **Peer-to-Peer (Mesh-capable) Topology**
* **Cluster-Tree Topology**

#### **Security Types**

* **Access Control** – device whitelist/blacklist
* **Data Encryption (AES-128)**
* **Integrity Protection (MIC)**
* **Frame Counter for Replay Protection**
* **Key Management Methods**

### **Working / Steps**

#### **Topology Working**

1. Devices join a PAN (Personal Area Network).
2. **Star:** All nodes communicate via a PAN Coordinator.
3. **Peer-to-peer:** Nodes connect directly and form mesh links.
4. **Cluster-tree:** Routers form hierarchical branches.

#### **Security Working**

1. Sender encrypts payload using AES-128.
2. A Message Integrity Code (MIC) is added.
3. Frame counters prevent replay attacks.
4. Receiver validates MIC and decrypts data.
5. Key management ensures secure key distribution.

**Topologies**

```
Star Topology:
       [Coordinator]
        /   |   \
    Node  Node  Node

Peer-to-Peer:
 Node──Node──Node
    \       /
      Node

Cluster-Tree:
    [Coordinator]
        │
     [Router]
      /    \
  Node     Node
```

**Security Flow**

```
Data → AES-128 Encryption → Add MIC → Transmit
                                   │
                        Receiver verifies → Decrypts

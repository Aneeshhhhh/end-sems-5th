**Definition**
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is an industrial control system used to remotely monitor and control machines, processes, and infrastructure in real time through sensors, RTUs, PLCs, and a central supervisory computer.

## **Types**

* **Monolithic SCADA** – standalone mainframe-based
* **Distributed SCADA** – LAN-based architecture
* **Networked SCADA** – internet-enabled systems
* **IoT-enabled SCADA** – cloud-integrated, wireless sensors

---

## **Working / Steps**

1. **Sensors** collect data from machines or processes.
2. **RTUs/PLCs** interface with physical devices and convert signals into digital data.
3. Data is transmitted to the **SCADA Master/Server**.
4. SCADA software displays real-time dashboards, alarms, and trends.
5. Operators issue control commands → sent back to PLCs/RTUs → actuators perform actions.

## **Advantages**

* Real-time monitoring and control
* Early fault detection through alarms
* Automation reduces human intervention
* Improves safety and operational efficiency
* Supports large-scale industrial systems

---

## **Disadvantages**

* Vulnerable to cyberattacks if not secured
* High installation and maintenance cost
* Complex configuration and integration
* Legacy systems may lack flexibility

---

## **Examples**

* Power grid monitoring
* Water treatment plants
* Oil & gas pipelines
* Manufacturing assembly lines
* Traffic control systems

---

## **Applications**

* Energy and utilities
* Industrial automation
* Transportation systems
* Building management
* Smart cities infrastructure

### **Short Note (Points)**

* SCADA monitors and controls industrial processes remotely.
* Uses **sensors → PLC/RTU → SCADA server → HMI**.
* Provides real-time data, alarms, and control actions.
* Used in power grids, plants, pipelines, and factories.

**Definition**
Data acquisition and integration in IoT refers to collecting raw data from sensors/devices and combining it into a unified, consistent format for processing, storage, and analytics.

**Types**

* **Sensor Data Acquisition** (temperature, humidity, motion)
* **Digital Data Acquisition** (logs, device states)
* **Analog-to-Digital Acquisition** (ADC conversion)
* **Edge Integration** (gateway-level preprocessing)
* **Cloud Integration** (data pipelines and APIs)

**Working / Steps**

1. **Sense/Collect Data:** Sensors measure physical parameters.
2. **Convert Data:** ADC converts analog signals to digital.
3. **Preprocess at Edge:** Filtering, noise removal, compression.
4. **Transmit Data:** Using MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, LoRaWAN, etc.
5. **Integrate Data:** Gateway/cloud normalizes formats (JSON/XML).
6. **Store & Manage:** Data goes into DBs, time-series stores, or cloud buckets.
7. **Make Data Usable:** Unified dataset feeds analytics, dashboards, AI models.

**Advantages**

* Ensures reliable and accurate sensor data
* Reduces noise and inconsistencies
* Enables large-scale analytics
* Supports interoperability between different devices
* Improves overall IoT system performance

**Disadvantages**

* Requires careful calibration and preprocessing
* Network issues can disrupt acquisition
* Integration is complex across multiple device types
* Data quality issues if sensors malfunction

**Examples**

* Temperature sensor data collected via ADC and sent to cloud
* Industrial machines sending vibration data to gateways
* Wearables transmitting health data to mobile/cloud apps
* Smart city sensors sending traffic/environment data to dashboards

**Applications**

* Smart homes and buildings
* Industrial automation (Industry 4.0)
* Smart healthcare monitoring
* Agricultural IoT (soil moisture, weather)
* Smart transportation systems

### **Short Note (Points)**

* Involves collecting raw sensor data and converting it to digital form.
* Edge preprocessing removes noise and formats data.
* Gateways/cloud perform integration using common formats (JSON/XML).
* Enables consistent storage and analytics for IoT systems.
* Critical for accuracy, reliability, and interoperability.

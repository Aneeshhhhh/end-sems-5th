**Definition**
Authorization of devices is the process of determining what an authenticated IoT device is allowed to access or perform within a system, based on predefined permissions and policies.

**Types**

* **Role-Based Authorization (RBAC)** – permissions based on device role.
* **Policy-Based Authorization** – rules controlling access (e.g., AWS IoT policies).
* **Attribute-Based Authorization (ABAC)** – uses device attributes (location, type).
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** – allow/deny lists for resources.

**Working / Steps**

1. Device first completes authentication.
2. System checks authorization policies linked to that device.
3. Authorization engine evaluates allowed actions (publish, subscribe, read, write, control).
4. Device is granted or denied access to specific topics, APIs, or resources.
5. Continuous monitoring ensures devices only operate within set permissions.

**Advantages**

* Prevents unauthorized device operations
* Ensures controlled access to sensitive resources
* Limits damage in case of device compromise
* Supports granular permissions
* Improves IoT system security and compliance

**Disadvantages**

* Complex to manage large-scale device permissions
* Misconfigured policies can block critical operations
* Requires periodic updates as devices evolve
* High admin overhead in dynamic environments

**Examples**

* AWS IoT policies restricting which MQTT topics a device can publish to
* Smart home device allowed only to control lights, not security systems
* Industrial sensors allowed only to send data, not actuate machines
* Medical IoT devices restricted to specific patient databases

**Applications**

* Smart homes and buildings
* Industrial automation (restricted control access)
* Healthcare IoT
* Smart grids and utilities
* Enterprise IoT networks

### **Short Note (Points)**

* Determines what actions an authenticated device is allowed to perform.
* Uses RBAC, ABAC, ACLs, or policy-based rules.
* Controls access to topics, APIs, and resources.
* Prevents unauthorized operations and limits device privileges.
* Critical for secure IoT deployments.

**Definition**
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or application to ensure that only legitimate entities can access IoT systems and data.

**Types**

* **Password/PIN-based authentication**
* **Token-based authentication (OAuth, JWT)**
* **Certificate-based authentication (X.509)**
* **Biometric authentication (fingerprint, face)**
* **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
* **Device-level authentication (unique IDs, keys)**

**Working / Steps**

1. Entity (user/device) sends identity credentials.
2. Server/cloud checks credentials against stored records.
3. Cryptographic verification (keys, certificates, tokens) ensures authenticity.
4. If valid → access granted; else → access denied.
5. Session tokens may be issued for ongoing communication.

**Advantages**

* Prevents unauthorized access
* Strengthens IoT security
* Supports encrypted communication
* Certificates/tokens reduce password risks
* MFA significantly increases protection

**Disadvantages**

* Key/certificate management complexity
* Extra computation overhead on low-power devices
* Password systems are vulnerable if poorly managed
* Improper token handling may cause breaches

**Examples**

* X.509 certificate authentication for IoT devices
* JWT tokens for API access
* MFA login for cloud dashboards
* Unique device keys burned into hardware

**Applications**

* IoT cloud platforms (AWS IoT, Azure IoT)
* Smart homes and security systems
* Industrial IoT device verification
* Healthcare IoT data protection
* Banking/enterprise systems

### **Short Note (Points)**

* Verifies identity of users/devices using passwords, tokens, or certificates.
* Prevents unauthorized access and ensures secure communication.
* MFA and certificate-based methods provide stronger protection.
* Essential for IoT device, user, and cloud platform security.

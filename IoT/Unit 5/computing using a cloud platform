**Definition**
Computing using a cloud platform refers to delivering computing resources—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, analytics, and software—over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis instead of relying on local infrastructure.

**Types**

* **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – Virtual machines, storage, networks (e.g., AWS EC2).
* **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – Runtime environments for app development (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
* **SaaS (Software as a Service)** – Ready-to-use applications over the cloud (e.g., Google Workspace).
* **FaaS (Function as a Service)** – Serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda).
* **Storage Services** – S3, Blob Storage, etc.
* **Database Services** – RDS, DynamoDB, Bigtable.

**Working / Steps**

1. User requests computing resources via cloud console/API.
2. Cloud provider provisions virtualized resources dynamically.
3. Workloads run on shared, scalable infrastructure.
4. Data stored in cloud storage/databases.
5. Analytics, ML, networking, security services integrate as needed.
6. Users monitor usage and pay only for resources consumed.

**Advantages**

* Scalability on demand
* Lower upfront cost
* High availability and global access
* Integration with analytics, ML, IoT services
* Reduced maintenance (provider-managed)

**Disadvantages**

* Dependency on internet connectivity
* Vendor lock-in
* Data security and privacy concerns
* Costs may rise with heavy usage

**Examples**

* Running IoT analytics on AWS EC2
* Hosting dashboards using Azure App Services
* Google Cloud Functions for IoT events
* Storing sensor data on AWS S3

**Applications**

* IoT device data processing
* Web and mobile app deployment
* Big data analytics
* AI/ML model training
* Enterprise IT infrastructure replacement

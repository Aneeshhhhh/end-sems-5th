**Definition**
Data analytics in IoT is the process of transforming raw sensor data into meaningful insights through cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing large-scale IoT information for decision-making.

**Types**

* **Descriptive Analytics** – summarizes past IoT data.
* **Diagnostic Analytics** – identifies causes behind events.
* **Predictive Analytics** – forecasts future outcomes using ML.
* **Prescriptive Analytics** – recommends optimal actions.
* **Real-time/Stream Analytics** – processes live sensor data.

**Working / Steps**

1. Collect data from sensors and IoT devices.
2. Preprocess (cleaning, filtering, normalization).
3. Store data in cloud or time-series databases.
4. Apply analytics engines (statistical, ML, rule-based).
5. Generate dashboards, alerts, predictions, or automated actions.

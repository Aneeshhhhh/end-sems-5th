**Definition**
Cloud service models describe the different ways cloud computing resources are delivered to users, based on how much control, management, and responsibility the user has.

**Types**

1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

**Working / Steps**

1. Cloud provider hosts infrastructure, platforms, or complete software.
2. Users access these services via web interfaces or APIs.
3. Responsibility division:

   * IaaS → user manages OS, apps.
   * PaaS → user manages apps only.
   * SaaS → user only uses the app.
4. Billing is based on usage.

```

**Advantages**

* **IaaS:** Flexible, scalable, customizable
* **PaaS:** Faster development, no server management
* **SaaS:** No installation, easy access, automatic updates

**Disadvantages**

* **IaaS:** Requires technical skills
* **PaaS:** Limited customization
* **SaaS:** Less control, data privacy concerns

**Examples**

* **IaaS:** AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine
* **PaaS:** Azure App Service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* **SaaS:** Gmail, Salesforce, Office 365

**Applications**

* IaaS → hosting servers, storage, virtual networks
* PaaS → application development and deployment
* SaaS → end-user applications delivered through cloud

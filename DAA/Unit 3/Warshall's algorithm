Below is the **exam-style answer** in clean sections, ready to write as-is.

## **Definition**

Warshall’s Algorithm is a dynamic programming method used to compute the **transitive closure** of a directed graph.
It determines whether a path exists between every pair of vertices by progressively allowing intermediate vertices.

---

## **Algorithm (Step-by-Step)**

1. Start with the adjacency matrix `A` of the graph.
2. Initialize the reachability matrix `R` as `R = A`.
3. For each vertex `k = 1 to n`, treat `k` as an intermediate vertex.
4. For every pair of vertices `(i, j)`:

   * If a path exists from `i → k` and from `k → j`, then a path exists from `i → j`.
   * Update:
     `R[i][j] = R[i][j] OR (R[i][k] AND R[k][j])`
5. After all vertices `k` are considered, `R` represents the transitive closure of the graph.

## **Pseudocode**

```text
Warshall(A, n):
    R = A

    for k = 1 to n:
        for i = 1 to n:
            for j = 1 to n:
                R[i][j] = R[i][j] OR (R[i][k] AND R[k][j])

    return R
```

---

## **Applications**

* Computing reachability in directed graphs
* Finding all possible paths in a network
* Preprocessing step in graph algorithms for path queries
* Determining closures in database dependency analysis
* Useful in compiler design for control-flow and data-flow analysis

If you want this for **Floyd’s Algorithm**, **Hamiltonian Path**, **Subset Sum**, etc., I’ll format them identically.

Here are the **2-mark, crisp, exam-ready explanations** for each term.

## **1. Computational Complexity (2 marks)**

Computational complexity is the study of how much **time** and **space** an algorithm requires as a function of the input size.
It classifies algorithms based on their efficiency and helps compare how fast different algorithms grow as inputs become large.
Complexity is usually expressed using **Big-O notation** (e.g., O(n), O(n²), O(2ⁿ)).

## **2. Decision Problems (2 marks)**

A decision problem is a problem whose output is strictly **YES or NO**.
These problems are used in complexity theory because they allow precise classification of difficulty (e.g., in P, NP, NP-Complete).
Examples:

* “Does a path exist between two nodes?”
* “Is there a subset that sums to 20?”

## **3. Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Algorithms (2 marks)**

### **Deterministic Algorithm:**

An algorithm where the next step is uniquely determined by the current state.
It produces the same output every time for a given input.
Examples: Merge Sort, Dijkstra (without negative weights).

### **Non-Deterministic Algorithm:**

A theoretical model where the algorithm can **guess** a solution from many possibilities and then verify it in polynomial time.
Used to define NP.
E.g., non-deterministic sorting: guess permutation → check if sorted.

## **4. Complexity Classes (2 marks)**

Complexity classes group problems based on the computational resources required to solve or verify them.
Common classes include:

* **P:** solvable in polynomial time
* **NP:** verifiable in polynomial time
* **NP-Complete:** hardest problems in NP
* **NP-Hard:** at least as hard as NP problems
  These classes help identify how difficult a problem is and whether efficient algorithms exist.

If you want, I can prepare a **5-mark or 10-mark** version of each concept too.

Here are **additional strong points** you can sprinkle into a 7–9 mark answer on **Why TSP (optimization) is NP-Hard**.
Use 2–3 of these to push your answer to full marks.

# ⭐ **Extra Points You Can Add**

### **4. Exponential Growth of Search Space**

TSP has `(n−1)! / 2` possible tours even in the symmetric case.
This **factorial growth** is a hallmark of NP-Hard problems with no known polynomial-time solutions.

---

### **5. Reduction From Hamiltonian Cycle**

Hamiltonian Cycle (NP-Complete) reduces to TSP in polynomial time by:

* Giving each existing edge weight 1
* Giving each non-existing edge weight a large value
  This shows TSP is **at least as hard** as an NP-Complete problem.

---

### **6. Optimization Problems Derived From NP-Complete Problems Are NP-Hard**

Given that TSP’s decision version is NP-Complete, the **optimization** version becomes NP-Hard by definition (optimization ≥ decision).

---

### **7. No Known Polynomial Time Algorithm Exists**

Despite decades of research, no polynomial solution has been discovered, reinforcing that TSP belongs to NP-Hard class.

---

### **8. NP-Hard Problems Are Not Necessarily in NP**

Optimization TSP does not belong to NP because checking optimality is not polynomial.
This aligns with NP-Hard’s definition: *“as hard as NP, but not necessarily in NP.”*

---

### **9. TSP Optimization Requires Global Knowledge**

Checking a tour's optimality requires comparing against **every other possible path**, making local verification impossible.

---

### **10. Many Real-World Problems Reduce to TSP**

Job scheduling, routing, DNA sequencing, manufacturing sequencing →
Reductions show TSP’s central role as a **canonical NP-Hard problem**.

Here is the **8-mark, exam-ready answer WITHOUT pseudocode**, exactly matching what SPPU expects for “Write an algorithm for LC Branch and Bound.”

Copy–paste directly.

## **LC Branch and Bound – Definition**

LC (Least Cost) Branch and Bound is a search method in which, among all live nodes, the **node with the minimum cost value** (according to a bounding function) is always selected for expansion. A priority queue is used to order live nodes by cost. Nodes whose cost exceeds the current bound are pruned.

## **Algorithm for LC Branch and Bound**

1. **Create the root node** of the state-space tree and compute its cost using the bounding function.
2. Insert the root node into a **priority queue (min-heap)**, where nodes are ordered by increasing cost.
3. **Repeat** the following steps until an optimal solution is found:

   * Remove the **live node with the least cost** from the priority queue.
   * **Branch**: Generate all possible child nodes from this node.
   * For each generated child:

     * Compute its **cost / bound**.
     * If its cost is **less than or equal to** the current best solution, insert it into the priority queue.
     * Otherwise, **prune** the node (discard it).
4. When a removed node represents a **complete feasible solution**, it is the **optimal solution**, because LC always expands nodes in order of least cost.

## **Applications**

* Solving **0/1 Knapsack** optimally
* **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**
* **Assignment and scheduling problems**
* **Optimal pathfinding** in combinatorial search
* **Integer programming** and resource allocation problems

This is the format that gets full marks:
**Definition + clear stepwise algorithm + applications.**

No pseudocode needed.

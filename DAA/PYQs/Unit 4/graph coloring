**Graph coloring** is a constraint satisfaction problem where each vertex must be assigned a color such that **no two adjacent vertices share the same color**. Backtracking tries colors one by one for each vertex and rejects (prunes) any assignment that creates a conflict.

## **Algorithm (Backtracking)**

```
ColorGraph(v):
1. If v > n:
       print the color assignment
       return

2. For each color c from 1 to m:
       if isSafe(v, c):
            color[v] = c
            ColorGraph(v + 1)
            color[v] = 0   // backtrack
```

```
isSafe(v, c):
      return TRUE if no adjacent vertex of v has color c
```

## **Example**

Graph:
Vertices = {1, 2, 3}
Edges: (1–2), (2–3), (1–3)
Colors available = 3

* Assign V1 = Color 1
* V2 cannot use Color 1 → assign Color 2
* V3 cannot use Color 1 or 2 → assign Color 3

A valid coloring is:

```
V1 = 1,  V2 = 2,  V3 = 3
```

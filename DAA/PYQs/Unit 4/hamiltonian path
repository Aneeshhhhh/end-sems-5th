## **Definition**

A Hamiltonian Path is a path in a graph that visits **every vertex exactly once**. Backtracking is used to explore all possible vertex sequences and reject those that violate adjacency or repetition constraints.

## **Algorithm (Backtracking Method)**

1. **Start with a path array** `path[1..n]` and place any starting vertex in `path[1]`.
2. For each position `k` from 2 to `n`, try to place a vertex that:

   * is **adjacent** to `path[k−1]`, and
   * has **not been used** earlier in the path.
3. If such a vertex exists, place it in `path[k]` and **recurse** for the next position.
4. If no valid vertex can be placed, **backtrack** to the previous position and try a different vertex.
5. If all vertices are placed (i.e., `k = n+1`), a **Hamiltonian Path** is found.
6. If all possibilities are exhausted without filling all positions, **no Hamiltonian Path exists**.

## **Pseudocode**

```text
Hamiltonian_Path(G, path, k):
    if k > n:
        return TRUE

    for each vertex v in G:
        if v is adjacent to path[k-1] AND v not in path:
            path[k] = v
            if Hamiltonian_Path(G, path, k+1) == TRUE:
                return TRUE
            remove v from path   // backtrack

    return FALSE
```

* Routing and scheduling problems
* DNA sequencing
* Network topology design

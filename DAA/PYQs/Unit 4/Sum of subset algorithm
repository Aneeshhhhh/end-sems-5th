## **Definition**

Backtracking is a depth-first search technique in which we build a solution step by step and abandon (backtrack from) any partial solution that violates the required conditions.

**Sum of Subset Problem:**
Given a set of positive integers and a target value **M**, the task is to find all subsets whose sum is exactly **M**.

## **Algorithm to Find Sum of Subset Using Backtracking**

1. Start with an empty subset and set `currentSum = 0`.
2. At each index `k`, consider two choices:

   * **Include** the element `w[k]` in the subset:

     * Add its value to `currentSum`.
     * If `currentSum == M`, record this subset as a solution.
     * If `currentSum < M`, continue to the next element.
   * **Exclude** the element `w[k]` and move to the next element without changing `currentSum`.
3. If at any point `currentSum > M` or all elements are considered, **backtrack** (stop exploring that branch).
4. Continue recursively exploring all include/exclude decisions until all valid subsets have been generated.

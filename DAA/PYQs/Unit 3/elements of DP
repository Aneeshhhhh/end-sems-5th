## **Principle of Dynamic Programming**

Dynamic Programming is based on the principle that:

> **A problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem once, and storing their results for reuse.**

It uses previously computed solutions to avoid repeated work, ensuring efficiency.
The key idea is **optimal substructure** and **overlapping subproblems**.

## **Explanation**

* A large problem is divided into **smaller subproblems**.
* Each subproblem is solved **only once** and its result is stored in a table (memoization or tabulation).
* These stored solutions are reused to build the solution of larger subproblems.
* This avoids exponential recomputation seen in naive recursion.
* DP guarantees optimality when subproblems themselves are optimally solved.

## **Elements of Dynamic Programming**

1. **Optimal Substructure** –
   The optimal solution of a problem depends on optimal solutions of its subproblems.

2. **Overlapping Subproblems** –
   The same subproblems recur multiple times and should be solved once and stored.

3. **State Definition** –
   Define the subproblem clearly (e.g., dp[i][j] meaning the best solution for i and j).

4. **State Transition / Recurrence Relation** –
   A formula that relates a state to smaller states.

5. **Memoization or Tabulation** –
   Storing solutions to avoid recomputation.

6. **Bottom-Up or Top-Down Approach** –
   Build solutions either starting from smallest subproblems (bottom-up) or solving recursively and storing (top-down).

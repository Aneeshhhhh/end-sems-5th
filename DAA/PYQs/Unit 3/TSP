## **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**

### **Definition**

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an optimization problem on a weighted graph where a salesman must start from a city, **visit every other city exactly once**, return to the starting city, and **minimize the total travel cost**.
Any feasible tour corresponds to a **Hamiltonian cycle** in the graph.

## **Advantages**

1. **Models many real-world routing problems** accurately.
2. **Clear objective function** (minimize total distance or cost).
3. Forms the basis for several optimization and AI algorithms.
4. Helps evaluate and compare performance of heuristics, DP, and Branch & Bound.

---

## **Disadvantages**

1. **NP-Hard**: exact solution becomes infeasible for large inputs.
2. Computational cost grows **factorially** with number of cities.
3. Requires **approximation or heuristics** for large datasets.
4. Sensitive to changes in distances or input data.

## **Applications**

1. **Route planning and logistics** (couriers, delivery vans, transportation).
2. **Chip manufacturing / PCB drilling** (minimizing movement of drill heads).
3. **DNA sequencing and genome assembly** (ordering fragments).
4. **Manufacturing scheduling** (optimal sequence of tasks).
5. **Robotics path planning** and autonomous vehicle routing.
